  serving  fl be where the guests serve themselves. This  sort is a  bang-up method
  for feeding  queen-size numbers of  tidy sum with minimal help. The  dinner  calamity
  is the  virtually  matter-of-fact and congenial  route in which to c atomic number

  the guests bring their own plate along the buffet line and  be  devoten a  parcel
  out from a server at  superstar or more stations.An advantage of buffets is that
  guests  name the ability to review  nutriment before selecting it and taking only

  a kitchen is that the layout should allow easy  modifying and continuous workflow
  from receiving raw material  by  cooking and cooking to final presentation. Equipments
  should be movable or  shopping centred on clean area.    In the kitchen serving
  food and there  must be a division of  readiness areas For  voiceVegetables storage

  \   good customer service,  woodland food and making diners  smell  valued is  authorized
  because satisfied customers are more likely to return. On  fairish a satisfied customer
  will tell two to three people  approximately good food and service whereas an unhappy

  or expectation  good deals are an important tool that will aid you in reaching your
  high customer satisfaction goals.There are numbers of restaurants according to different
  customers like family restaurant, couples restaurants like valentines. (Customer

  places and silence and the whole restaurant  adorn with dim lights and light music.
  Customer profiles in restaurant Customer profiles also help you develop targeted
  marketing plans and help you ensure your products and services meet the needs of
  your intended audience. There are two basic types of customer profiles demographic
  profiles Demographics profiles are based on characteristics like age, gender, income
  levels, marital status, place of residence, etc.In marketing  toll demographic profiles
  tend to break down customers into age, social class, and gender. For example younger
  buyers  may make buying decisions based on how they feel the purchase will cause
  them to be perceived and older buyers may focus on quality or safety. Wealthy customers
  may be  impulsive to pay a best for service or for a perceived value while lower
  income customers may be more likely to focus on price. Its all depend on perso   n
  status if there is a rich person buy something than surely he will pay more without
  thinking anything but other lower class person first see the price and  whence decide.Behavior
  profiles Behavior profiles focus on actions and focus on types of items were purchased
  how frequently items are purchased and the average transaction value or which items
  were purchased in  union with other items. (Customer profiles) Types of customers
  1) Loyal Customers Naturally we need to be communicating with those customers who
  on a regular basis by telephone, mail, email etc. These people are the ones who
  can and should influence our buying and merchandising decisions. Nothing will make
  a Loyal Customer feel better than soliciting their  stimulant drug and showing them
  how much you value it.In my mind you can never do enough for them. Customer recommends
  to others and as a result business  fruit inclined. 2) Discount Customers This category
  helps ensure inventory is turning over and as a result it i   s a key contributor
  to cash flow. This same group  in time can  a great deal wind up  be restaurant
  money because they are more inclined to return product. 3)  lust Customers Clearly
  this is the segment of our clientele that we all like to serve. There is  cryptograph
  more exciting than assisting an Impulse shopper and having them respond favorably
  to our recommendations.We want to target our dis recreates towards this group because
  they will provide us with a significant amount of customer insight and  cogniseledge.
  4) Need-Based Customers People in this category are  control by a specific need.
  When they enter the  inclose and they will look to see if they can have that need
  filled quickly. If not they will leave right away. They buy for a variety of reasons
  such as a specific occasion and a specific need or an absolute price point. As difficult
  as it can be to satisfy these  patient of of peoples and they can also become Loyal
  Customers if they are well taken care of.Salespeople    may not find them to be
  a lot of fun to serve but in the end they can often represent your greatest source
  of long-term  offshoot. 5)  range Customers For many stores and restaurants this
  is the largest segment in  call of traffic while at the same time they make up the
  smallest percentage of sales. mostly kind of people attract from the location of
  the restaurant. Keep in mind however that although they may not represent a large
  percentage of  present(prenominal) sales and they are a real voice for restaurant
  business in the community.Many Wanderers shop merely for the interaction and experience
  it provides them. Shopping is no different to them than it is for another person
  to go to the gym on a regular basis. Since they are merely looking for interaction
  and they are also very likely to communicate to others the experience they had in
  the store. Therefore although  vagabond Customers cannot be ignored, the time spent
  with them needs to be minimized. Pricing consideration expectat   ions Prices play
  main role in business because in restaurant different types of customers come some
  are from rich families and some from medium class.For example rich customer spends
  lots of money on food but the middle class customer thinks what to eat and they
  look on price? And Always find reasonable prices so the thing is this if restaurant
  design their menu according to the customer spending power than it will good for
  both business and customer. Prices should implement according to the target market
  than business grow up. Customer need the food prices are reasonable according to
  their spending power different options provided to customers in food so customer
  will be happy and satisfied. 1. factors affecting average spending power in hospitality
  business. Types of hospitality outlets, menu range, pricing consideration Firstly
  the type of menu offered by an establishment and the variety of menu choice should
  also enhance the  come in meal experience. For a lower level market fir   st price
  of food. If the customer is paying $50 for three course meal the range of menu items
  that can be made available within the cost limits of such an operation is plain
  more limited than in operations where the customers average spending power is higher.Secondly,
  the amount of time taken to consume meals at this level of the market may vary  in
  the midst of half an hour to one hour but will rarely exceed this. The menu choice
  offered by a restaurant is therefore dependent on a number of int skidelated factors
  like * Price the customer is  uncoerced to pay * The amount of time available for
  the meal experience * The level of the market in which restaurant situated * The
  production and service facilities * Skills and  rung Expectations and requirementsA
  single customer or group of customers arriving at a restaurant for a meal bring
  with them a  serial of expectations regarding that restaurant and the type of service
  they will receive and the price they will pay, the  pass judgmen   t good atmosphere
  and mood of the restaurant etc. The customer expectation may be varied and numerous,
  ranging from the restaurant which the customer frequents because they want to be
  seen there and participate in its social atmosphere, to the small quiet restaurant
  where the customer may go because of its  suggest and personal nature.If customers
  sense disharmony, however  mingled with their expectation of the restaurant and
  the actual product they find for example, it is too intimate for the occasion and
  they may not enter the restaurant but  spot another. If disharmony is not realized
  until customers are seated at the table and it is unlikely that they will leave
  but will have a hurried and uncomfortable meal. Level of service The higher the
  cost of the meal to the customer and the more service the customer expects to receive.
  The cost of the meal to customers  augments so will the amount of service they receive.It
  is necessary for a restaurant to  describe the level of service.    if a restaurant
  has a very formal type of food and beverage service  unremarkably associated with
  high class operations, the other aspects of the restaurant service should be equally
  formal the speed, efficiency and  outfit of staff, the degree of personalization
  and courtesy the customers receives, and so on. It is important for a restaurant
  operation to consider not only the service of the food and beverage for which the
  staffs are usually adequately trained, but also to remember the indirect service
  aspect of the operation which are all part of the customers meal experience.The
  meal experience Eat and drink experience The meal experience may be defined as a
  \ series of events both  distinct and intangible that a customer experiences when
  eating out. Tangible- which can be feeling by touching, seeing like restaurant tables,
  chairs etc. Intangible- which can be only sensed/felt like restaurant atmosphere
  etc. It is difficult to define exactly where a meal and drink experience actual
  \  ly starts and ends although it is usually assumed that the main part of the experience
  begins when a customer enters a restaurant and ends when he leaves the restaurant.The
  series of events and experiences customers undergo when eating out may be divided
  into those tangible aspects of the product that is the food and drink and those
  intangible aspects such as service, atmosphere, mood, etc. So it is necessary for
  the tangible and intangible components of the restaurant to combine together and
  to be seen by the customer as one total product The menu is the center piece of
  any restaurant establishment. it is not a food list items for sale but the reason
  behind the establishment exist Management issues  staffing 1) Floor  prudence in
  staffingIt includes floor managing staff and they provides service to guests or
  customers in restaurant. Staff allocates on different  stemmas from opening hours
  to closing hours. Manager is responsible for their staff and all safety and health
  regulations   . Manger motivates all other staff in front  powerfulness and take

  like chef, head chef, dishwasher and kitchen hand.Kitchen is the place food  vigilant

  increase average checks and  appoint profits sky high from insides to outsides the
  restaurant, the marketing plan is the  itinerary map to achieves specific sales
  objectives. it includes tv, radio billboards or  localized  area program.In chevaliers
  we will implement setup frequency dinning programs and data base programs that  presently
  tell who is customer in restaurant, their birthdays, and anniversaries and where
  they live Finance Money plays very important role in any business. And it is also
  important to know how to manage finance. Management always ready to manage all situations
  like when season off the restaurant sales automatically down and management knows
  how to handle that particular situation. Managing day by day expenses in restaura
  \  nt business and POS system helps to manage all sales and inventory. Control systemsA
  big emphasis is organism placed on extensive research into the quality and integrity
  of restaurant products. Restaurant management will constantly  tried and true for
  high  hackneyeds of freshness and purity. Food costs and inventory control will
  be handled by computer system and checked daily by management. Service standards
  There are different types of services provided in restaurants like buffet service,
  silver service, table service and tray service. As the service level increases the
  labour costs increases because of the increased skill level and the quantity and
  quality of equipment increases.A higher standard of customer service requires a
  higher standard of decor, food quality, equipment and staff. More facilities cost
  more. The delivery of a consistently high standard of service requires a higher
  proportion of product, staff and equipment.  tonus systems The quality of service
  is another fa   ctor that contributes to restaurant customer satisfaction. This
  is a particularly important factor to full-service restaurants because they are
  typically more  high-ticket(prenominal) and slower than quick-service restaurants.Many
  factors go into the overall quality of service at a restaurant such as how positively
  customers feel  more or less each member of the restaurant staff they interact with.
  Some customers may be more concerned with the social interactions with the wait
  staff, while other customers are more focused on how quickly dishes are removed
  and  furnish are refilled. The relative importance of these different factors often
  depends on the style of restaurant and the outlook of a particular customer. Team
  working All members of a team must feel empowered to work towards quality.This  meaning
  if a waitress does not feel that a meal is up to standard that she has the right
  to refuse to take the dish to the customer. Staff should be encouraged to share
  their ideas  rough h   ow to improve the quality of the organization often as they
  are the ones dealing directly with the customers they have more  reusable ideas
  than management. Training Management will train employees in food service  sanitation.
  Each employee shall be trained in food service sanitation quarterly. Lo2 understand

  is one of the steps that go into  be and targeting particular markets. It is the
  process of dividing a market into a distinct group of buyers that require different
  products or marketing mixes it targets specialty markets that will promote products
  and services more effectively than a business aiming average customer. It is easiest
  way of marketing in groups and it helps to get knowledge  astir(predicate) customers

  * Behavior bases like product knowledge, usage, responses and attitudes of customers
  * Demographic basis like age, occupation, age and family size * Psychographic bases
  like lifestyles, values and  nature * Geographic bases like states, regions and
  countries Market segmentation is important for business and for development. We

  can increase sales, turnover and ensure the menu remains balanced in terms of sales
  mix and popularity. The menu can designed in such ways to seduce and convince the
  diners to choose a specific menu item by the wording and how the dish described.
  Fine dinning restaurant provide menu with less wording, naming exotic ingredients.

  Advertising Restaurant advertising comes in many forms. Radio spots  theme ads,
  TV commercials even coupons are al   l ways to advertise a restaurant. We can hire
  a PR agency to help you get your  contentedness out or you can do it yourself. Advertising
  is not a one-size-fits-all deal. Advertising plans vary from year to year, season
  to season. Like we have a busy summer season and less business in the winter and
  we will need two decisively different advertising plans.While advertising we can
  show discounts/coupons and special offers for customers so it can develop  filth
  image in the eyes of customers. Customers will definitely think about restaurant
  and definitely plan to go that particular restaurant. Websites is another option
  where we put new offers and menus for customers. Customers will directly order from
  internet. It helps to generate income from customers. Food and beverage planning

  beverage section of any place, he/she expects something more than just what is served.The
  \ anticipate things include quality, timeliness as well as cost effectiveness however
  what if you can give the guest more than what he/she has expected Food hygiene in
  restaurant Good food hygiene in restaurant is of vital importance for the pleasure
  of customers and the continued success of restaurant business. Customer also expects
  where they eat the place should be neat and clean and kitchen should be clean while

  and moulds found in food can cause food poisoning, leading to a whole host of unpleasant
  symptoms, such as stomach pains, dia   rrhoea and vomiting. It is for customers

  matters Guests expect to be served by a good looking and well-dressed staff. Staff
  cannot be untidy will their face, hair or clothes. The guests should not feel that
  the restaurant management is too harsh on the staff in terms of salaries or duty
  such that they cannot afford a proper uniform. This creates a wrong impression.
  Serve the food in warm, well washed dishes/conta   iners nd all plates, bowls used
  should be well washed and cleaned.  attach knowledge about the product The guests
  could have a query about the food and beverage they are consuming or are about to

  of service according customers like young people want very formal service and old
  people like quick service and on time. Service is very important part of any restaurant.
  Restaurant depends on the best service.If the service does not meet the customers
  expectations and customer felt the service very good then they defiantly come back
  to restaurant. Customer service covers many different parts of restaurants day to
  day operations and going far beyond the front of the staff. In chevaliers there
  is no proper service provide to customers so they will not come again because of

  that restaurant have good reputation in market. Brand loyalty is depending on their
  service and good quality of food. Customers want to feel important They know that
  restaurant have lots of other customers and clients but they just love it when staff
  makes them feel special. Flexibility Customers hate to hear the word No or it cannot
  be done. Its not always possible to say yes to a customer or do exactly what they
  want however it is important to be as flexible as you can. Staff needs to motivate
  and convince customer to take another meal or service.If someone to know their name
  (names of customers) A customer name is one of the sweetest sounds they will ever
  hear. If you use a customers name when you talk to them it indicates that you recognize
  them as an individual. Dont use it too often as it can    become irritating, but
  definitely at the start and the end of a conversation. 2. 3 assess the opportunities
  and constraints affecting product and service development within a hospitality environment
  Food and nutrition Dietary requirements Proteins are required throughout life to
  create, maintain and renew human body.The amount of proteins required changes with
  age, during growth periods and depending on health of human body. Now days people
  are very health conscious so according to their needs restaurant provide food of
  their choices For example restaurants provides special kids menu age 2 to 12 and
  these are foods that kids tend to like and which meet kids dietary requirements
  like fruits. For Strict vegetarian Restaurants do not mix any animal products like
  beef, chicken,  tip, eggs and they provide pure vegetarian food to customers. They
  provide different kinds of salads, other vege dishes.Regulations acts in implement
  on restaurant and employer liability towards the customers ar   e as follows (class
  work) Health and safety act There are laws and systems that have been  launch to
  help ensure that the food served in restaurants is safe. Bacteria grow very easily
  if given the chance. The local Health Department will send out inspectors to make
  sure that the chefs and servers are following the proper guidelines. Inspectors
  will issue fines for minor violations and can shut you down for major violations.
  This act states that the relation of guest and staff protected from health issues.During
  work the environment should be neat and clean. People should work in clean environment
  and make food in clean place. In restaurant they can use clean and right equipments
  and cutlery. Employment act 1992 The health and safety in  utilisation act 1992
  states that to prevent harm to the all the employee who all are working in the premises
  and for other person who is in the neighborhood of work should also be protected
  \ further the customer who all come to dine in the premises s   hould also be taken
  care off. Restaurant staff never provided food which can harmful for guest and they
  should prevent them from food.They need to check  release dates and food storage
  in right temperature and there should be system which followed by business from
  food deliveries in the restaurant on time. It also include proper receiving, storage,
  preparation, cooking and serving food. Staff training should be compulsory because
  of their knowledge. Restaurant should prevent customers from hazards. The privacy

  details of the guest should not to be disclosed to any one at any point of time.Customer
  privacy act implies in restaurant operations. No one can disclose any information
  about customers. Human rights act According to the Human rights act 1993 says that
  nobody can discriminate any one on the basis of Race, color, ethnic origin, disability,
  gender, marital status, age, religion, political opi   nion, employment status,
  sexual orientation. Trading act Shop trading repeal act 1990 defines about the hours
  of opening the business which also help the customer to be aware about their purchasing
  time. 2. evaluate different merchandising opportunities for hospitality products
  and services A combination of local media and local store marketing programs will
  be utilized at each location. Local store marketing is most effective, followed
  by radio, then print. As soon as a concentration of stores is established in a market
  then broader media will be explored. Advertising is best form to promote restaurant.
  By providing an entertaining environment with unbeatable quality at an unbelievable
  price in a clean and friendly restaurant than it automatically increases sales.There
  are some methods of advertising such as TV, radio commercials and  newspaper ads
  can be very expensive. If any person ready to open a new restaurant or promote existing
  restaurant and they dont have a very big advert   ising budget than there are still
  several ways to promote restaurant even on a low budget. Restaurant Website One
  of the most powerful tools a restaurant their own websites. More and more people
  are turning to the World Wide Web for information  kind of than the yellow pages.
  Maintaining a website is crucial for any business today.It is  straightforwardst
  way to attract customer and get sales profit. People sell products directly to consumers
  and it should give the basic information of restaurant and about hours, telephone
  number, directions and a  facsimile of menu. Restaurant also advertises on website
  customer promotions on weekly promotions such as an early bird menu or happy hour
  details.. One of the best ways to get business through restaurant website is linking
  with other businesses such as local hotels, the chamber of commerce and local tourist
  information sites.Menu Flyers Creating a menu flyer or a take-out menu is another
  way to get the word out about restaurant without b   reaking the bank. Place these
  flyers at local hotels, chambers of commerce and to local businesses. Menu flyers
  placed on popular tourist destinations as well such ski mountains, parks or whatever
  place in the area that draws a crowd. On flyers menu we are not able to put whole
  menu so it is ok if we post some popular dishes and including hours and any special
  promotions like happy hours, direction and contact number.Newspapers Newspaper advertisement
  is very cheapest way to promote restaurant because if we dont have enough money
  to promote on high level, like bigger advertisements than we advertise restaurant
  on newspaper within less amount. Menu Inserts Menu inserts are a great way to advertise
  new promotions or services to existing customer base. For example if there is a
  introducing a new promotion such as a wine tasting dinner on the first Friday of
  each month, we can place an insert advertise that is in regular menu. Theme nightsTheme
  nights like particular theme on the day wh   ich are not preparing in restaurant
  before but now restaurant decide to create French menu with flowering theme and
  beautiful decoration with candles. According to customer interest if someone like
  French food or flowering theme than they will definitely come to restaurant. Customer
  like fun loving nights. It increases there interest to come again and again. When
  to Spend More on Advertising? Restaurants should plan to increase their advertising
  budgets during the holiday season.In October or early November, run a newspaper
  ad reminding the public to book their holiday parties and order their party platters.
  If the place where restaurant located tourist destination then it is a good idea
  to place an ad in the local paper and or tourist paper prior to the busy season
  May for the summer months, November for the winter months. Many chambers of commerce
  or local  touristry associations will publish a newspaper geared specifically toward
  tourists. It highlights all the sights and activit   ies of an area. Advertising
  is key to gaining new business for your restaurant.However, you dont have to spend
  a fortune to attract new business, when you think outside of the traditional advertising
  box. Lo3 understand pricing and profitability concepts within hospitality operations
  3. 1 evaluate different methods of pricing taking into account additional pricing
  considerations It is all about product and how much to  placard for product or service.
  There numbers of strategies to overcome problem in manage product price or menu
  price. There are some Pricing strategies to set the price of product and service
  like cost, positioning and maximizing quantity.Correct pricing is very important
  in restaurant business or any other business. There are  quatern methods to calculate
  the pricing. Some of the pricing methods are following Methods of pricing 1)Cost-plus
  pricing Cost-plus pricing is the simplest pricing method. The  faithful calculates
  the cost of producing the product and adds on    a percentage (profit) to that price
  to give the selling price. This method although simple has two flaws it takes no
  account of demand and there is no way of determining if potential customers will
  purchase the product at the  compute price.Set the price at your production cost,
  including both cost of goods and fixed costs at your current volume, plus a certain
  profit margin. For example, widgets cost $20 in raw materials and production costs
  and at current sales volume or anticipated initial sales volume and fixed costs
  come to $30 per unit. Total cost is $50 per unit. Then decide that want to operate
  at a 20% markup, so add $10 (20% x $50) to the cost and come up with a price of
  $60 per unit. So long as you have costs calculated correctly and have accurately
  predicted your sales volume and it will always be operating at a profit. )Psychological
  pricing Hitting price points that are significant for example pricing items at $14.
  99 instead of $15 customer perceive them as  creation    better value. It is easy
  way to attract customers and make more money from this strategy. And also covers
  pricing items too low on a menu in comparison to other dishes 3)Breakeven pricing
  It may define as that volume of business at which total costs are equal to sales
  and where neither profit nor loss is made. Total sales and total expenses are equal
  and there is neither loss nor profit. 4)Popular price pointsThere are certain prices
  points (specific prices) at which people become much more willing to buy a certain
  type of product. For example under $100 is a popular price point. Enough under $20
  to be under $20 with sales  tax is another popular price point, because its one
  bill that people commonly carry. Meals under $5 are still a popular price point,
  as are entree or snack items under $1 notice how many fast-food places have a $0.
  99 value menu. Dropping price to a popular price point might mean a lower margin
  but more than enough increase in sales to  set off it. 5)Fair pricin   gSometimes
  it simply doesnt matter what the value of the product is even if we dont have any
  direct competition. There is simply a limit to what consumers perceive as fair.
  If its obvious that our product only cost $20 to manufacture even if it delivered
  $1000 in value, it is a hard time charging two or three thousand dollars for it
  and people would just feel like they were being squeezed. A little market testing
  will help to determine the maximum price consumers will perceive as fair. 6)Positioning
  Poisoning  performer pricing about product and it is a key part of pricing.For example
  if anybody running discount store than he always set their prices lower than their
  competitors. The pricing has to be constant with the poisoning. Customers always
  want reasonable price and good quality of food. 7)Cost based pricing In hospitality
  this involves accurately calculating the food or beverage cost of per unit usually
  done by using a standard recipe than a percentage is added for gross profi   t to
  arrive at the selling price. It is important to ensure that the gross profit percentage
  added is enough to cover all fixed and variable cost as well as the  desire profit
  margin. )Market oriented pricing (Qualitative) This method looks at the relationship
  between price and value for money like how much people are prepared to spend and
  will take into account the whole meal experience from decor of restaurant, menu
  items, staff service and cleaning. Factors effects on pricing Price must always
  be consistent with the customers perception of value. The higher price the greater
  the customers expectation and it is to disappoint. If the product is perceived to
  be too expensive the customer will find substitutes.If the product is priced too
  low the customer may feel it reflects inferior quality. Budget perspective a price
  needs to include the cost to the business as well as the profit expectations. GST
  cost It is a value with added tax and it is compulsory for  eachone who buys product
  \   and service from seller. For example when chef costing the menu he will include
  tax cost with dish cost. (pricing methods) 3. 2 assess the factors in hospitality
  operations which effect revenue generation and profitability Pricing is one of the
  quartette elements of the marketing mix, along with product, place and promotion.Pricing
  strategy is important for companies who wish to achieve success by finding the price
  point where they can  increase sales and profits. Companies may use a variety of
  pricing strategies, depending on their own unique marketing goals and objectives.
  Portion Control One reason that chain restaurants are so successful is that they
  have a firm handle on portion control. The cooks in those restaurants know exactly
  how much of each ingredient to put in every dish. For example, shrimp scampi may
  have a portion control of six shrimp per dish.Therefore, every shrimp scampi that
  goes out of that kitchen will have six shrimp in it no more, no less. This is portion
  c   ontrol. In order to practice portion control in your own kitchen everything
  should be measured out. Chicken, beef and fish should all be weighed, while shredded
  cheese can be stored in portion control cups and a measuring cup can dish out mashed
  potatoes. Once you feel comfortable cooking about menu, then serving amounts (sort
  of like Rachael Ray) but in the early stages of your restaurant, err on the side
  of caution and measure everything out.Another way to practice portion control is
  to purchase proportioned items, such as steaks, burger patties, chicken breasts,
  and pizza dough. They may be more expensive but can save you money in labor and
  food waste. Sales mix Sales mix is a combination of different sales products like
  beverages, food, desert and side coffees. Total of brunch sales, dinner sales is
  equal to total revenue. Customer service Good customer service is the life blood
  of any business. In a fine dining restaurant customers pay for service to enjoy
  food and atmosphere.A    waiter or waitress serves customer food and beverages and
  it is up to staff that the customer back again to take service. It means if the
  staff provides fine and attractive service. Good customer is all about bringing
  customers back and about sending them away happy and happy enough to pass positive
  feedback about business. Staff knowledge Staff should know about menu items on tips
  with their descriptions and if staffs have knowledge about menu and beverages it
  will be a positive point and if customer asks about product than staff should answer
  with confidence.It will be good impressions on customers and they would like to
  some more food or come back again. Customer feel good as they get what they want
  and customer will be enjoy service. Selling skills Servers also known as waiters
  and waitresses are a key part of your restaurant staff. Without good service, few
  customers would return to any restaurant. A good server does more than just wait
  on customers. He or she is a salesperson   . (Perhaps they should be called sellers,
  instead. ) They should not just be taking orders and delivering food. They should
  be selling a product- your restaurant menu. A good server knows how to up-sell.Up-selling
  is simply getting a customer to spend more than he was originally intending. Factors
  affecting profitability in restaurant business that is LO2 AND LO3 CLASS NOTES Class

  than customer get dissatisfy they will never come back to restaurant 8. Effect on
  brand image if there is any problem in operations 9.Hygiene if there is no proper
  cleaning in kitchen than it direct effect on food so as a result customer will get
  \ purge from that food and it effe   cts on restaurant image Employees duties for
  the  vindication of the consumer 1. Provide and maintain a safe workplace which
  uses safe equipment and areas where customer think I am safe and they come again
  and again if they like place. 2. Prevent risks from use of any article or  centre
  and from exposure to physical agents and noise 3. Prevent any improper conduct or
  behavior likely to put the safety, health and welfare of employees at risk 4.Provide
  instructions and training to employees on health and safety 5. Provide protective
  clothing and equipment to employees 6. Appointing a capable person as the organizations
  Safety Officer which helps when someone in danger 7. To take reasonable care to
  protect the health and safety of themselves and of other people in the workplace
  8. Not to engage in improper behavior that will endanger themselves or others 9.
  Not to be under the influence of drink or drugs in the workplace 10. To complaint
  any defects in the place of work or equipment wh   ich are not good or danger to
  health and safetyLo4 Areas that are commonly appraised Deliveries on time If deliveries
  come on time we will not run out anything. Moreover we could store at right temperature
  on right place. If delivers come on time then chef has time to organize stuff. Wrong
  deliveries if wrong delivers come than there are many problems that may arise like
  chef cannot do preparation without his products. If customer asks for particular
  item in the menu which we donot have due to wrong deliveries. May be instead of
  waiting customer would prefer go and try somewhere else. Short term deliveriesShort
  term deliveries are known as like takeaways. Quality of items Quality should be
  good if the quality not good than customer always dissatisfied from service and
  success or failure of a restaurant is  tied to the quality of the product, service
  and atmosphere. Customers expect fresh food that is tastefully prepared. They want
  impeccable service from knowledgeable staff and they    want an environment that
  is clean and comfortable. By reviewing a checklist of vital points daily, restaurant
  consistently provide a quality product that will keep customers coming back for
  more.  rear end of  signboard Commercial kitchens must be clean and sanitary. Customers
  or guest never see the kitchen area and cleanliness but restaurant should provide
  quality food with hygiene. Food is rotated in each delivery to maintain freshness.
