  March, <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a> Boutique
  River Cruise Collection holds “Kickoff,” a combination staff training/global sales
  conference/motivational retreat/<a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/family\">family</a>
  reunion. I attended the 2019 edition last week in Dusseldorf, Germany.</p>\n<p>This
  <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/year\">year</a>, on the second evening
  of this business and social event, an auction was held to sell, piece by piece,
  artwork created by some of the 500 staff who were in attendance. The proce benefit
  a local hospital that provides services to <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/children\">children</a>
  with terminal diseases.</p>\n<p>Sales manager Sheryl Garavelli paid 750 euros for
  a painting of a solitary chair. After taking possession of it, she walked over to
  Kristian Anderson, senior vice <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/president\">president</a>
  of global sales, and handed it to him. </p>\n<p>The next morning, I asked him why.</p>\n<p>“The
  day before, at the start of our sales meeting, I had brought an empty chair onto
  the stage,” Anderson told me. “I said to the team that it would stay up there as
  a reminder of the person who wasn’t present, but for whom we put in all of our time,
  energy and focus. It’s the person who fuels our growth. The chair, I said, represents
  <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/travel\">travel</a> <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a>. And now, that painting will be my own reminder
  to keep them always present.”</p>\n<p>He told me another story about the importance
  of the people represented by that chair. <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>
  is an underwriter for the PBS program “Amanpour  <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/company\">Company</a>,”
  and he said there was a sticking point in the negotiations with the network.</p>\n<p>“We
  had asked that the tagline include a phrase to the effect of, ‘Contact your <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/travel\">travel</a> advisor to book your next <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a> trip.’ Believe it or not, they said no.”</p>\n<p>It
  wasn’t that the network is anti-<a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/travel\">travel</a>
  agent, but their rules only allow the actual underwriter to be mentioned in a credit.</p>\n<p>“We
  had to fight for a referral to <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a>,
  and we were prepared to walk away if we didn’t get it,” Anderson said. “In the end,
  we were able to work with their writers to come up with ‘Bookings available through
  your <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/travel\">travel</a> advisor,’ which
  worked within their guidelines.”</p>\n<p>Too little water?</p>\n<p>Kickoff, Anderson
  told me, is the only time everyone gets together and reviews the successes and challenges
  of past <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/year\">year</a>, where they are
  at moment and where they’re heading. They review how to adapt to, and take advantage
  of, changing market conditions. A record number of passengers sailed in 2018, and
  growth is predicted for 2019, but success was uneven. </p>\n<p>“Australia is in
  a slump. Latin America is doing well. The U.S. is stable,” Anderson said. “We know
  the election season could have a great impact on consumer demand, and also that
  we can get ahead of that now.”</p>\n<p>While the meet-up was overwhelmingly upbeat,
  challenges were acknowledged. As a <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/new\">new</a>
  season begins, <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>
  has at least one thing in common with all other operators on European rivers: fresh
  memories of record low water levels that resulted in disrupted — or, in the industry’s
  preferred terminology, “deviated” — departures. </p>\n<p>I was able to take advantage
  of Kickstart’s concentration of management to hold an informal roundtable on that
  topic with <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>‘s director
  of nautical operations, Alexander Oost; its vice <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/president\">president</a>,
  technical, Rolf Reachlan; its director of hotel operations, Yoke De Bruyn; and Jean-Marie
  Queriaud, director of operations in France.</p>\n<p>The extremes of last <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/year\">year</a>‘s water deficit tested the industry and laid bare any
  weaknesses for all to see. In particular, the sector came under fire for under-communicating
  with guests and <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/travel\">travel</a> <a
  class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a>.</p>\n<p>“We were
  accustomed to a month or two of lower levels, but half a <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/year\">year</a>?” Oost said. “We now have <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/new\">new</a> policies in place. We can’t control the weather, but we
  can control messaging. The client wants to be informed about potential problems
  as early as possible. Communication is key here.”</p>\n<p>Part of the challenge
  lies in working with a global clientele. Even the best predictions of what’s going
  to happen might not be timely enough for some guests, he said. “An Australian would
  want to know about potential problems two weeks ahead of time, but our best predictions
  may be only one week out. And sometimes, those predictions are wrong.”</p>\n<p>Queriad
  said that experiencing such an intense season of low water did improve the line’s
  ability to anticipate issues and improve its predictive capabilities. It also improved
  decision-making processes about when to prepare to deviate or even cancel a sailing,
  which <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a> did for the
  <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/first\">first</a> time in 2018.</p>\n<p>Among
  the options they weigh are whether they can move a vessel with a shallower draft
  to an area where water levels might drop, Oost said.</p>\n<p>“Deviation is a very
  costly exercise,” Queriad added, citing the organization of motor coaches and securing
  hotel rooms. “And even if you do all that right, a quarter of the guests will be
  dissatisfied.”</p>\n<p>Oost said, “No matter what you do and how carefully you explain
  everything, it’s not always the right decision for every guest.”</p>\n<p>A deviated
  or canceled voyage has an impact on staff as well as the guests, De Bruyn said.
  </p>\n<p>“We know this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many people, and if
  they do not have the cruise they expect, everyone onboard also feels terrible,”
  he said.</p>\n<p>Too many boats?</p>\n<p><a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>
  believes another industry challenge is overtourism on the rivers.</p>\n<p>“It’s
  a real threat,” Brett <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/tollman\">Tollman</a>,
  CEO of <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/parent\">parent</a> <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/company\">company</a> the <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/travel\">Travel</a>
  Corporation, said in an interview. The industry, he said, has “more than enough
  capacity on the rivers in Europe. You wake up in the morning and you see four, five,
  six boats tethered together, and at some point, a government is going to say, ‘Enough!’.
  If you don’t believe there’s too much capacity, why are we seeing the two-for-one
  offers, or 75% off? What good is that for any <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/company\">company</a>
  or for the industry?”</p>\n<p>In the roundtable discussion, Reachlan said pushback
  to additional capacity is already coming from residents. The areas around ports
  have traditionally been attractive places to live, and too many boats make it less
  attractive.</p>\n<p>“The nature of this business is intimacy,” Queriad asserted.
  “Unfortunately, three ships come into the same dock, and there are 12 buses waiting.
  People don’t know which bus to join. It’s not good for guests. It’s not good for
  residents. Nobody wins.”</p>\n<p>Current operational functions and infrastructure
  are under stress, Oost said. </p>\n<p>“Some ports are saying we want to have you,
  but we already have too many ships,” he said. “You can build extra docks, but then
  you need extra coaches. You have to have a trained crew, and all that takes time.”</p>\n<p>Still,
  Oost believes there’s room for growth, as long as it’s thoughtful growth. He and
  his team are looking at maps and calendars for lesser-known ports and days when
  fewer ships are present at popular stops. </p>\n<p>“And you always look for <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/new\">new</a> rivers, which present their own challenges because you’re
  a pioneer,” Oost said</p>\n<p>“Thoughtful” was a word that came up frequently at
  <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>‘s Kickstart. Charts
  projected by the line’s CEO, Ellen Bettridge, during her “state of the <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/company\">company</a>” address, showed how many fewer ships the <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/company\">company</a> was adding than was true, on average, of the eight
  largest lines combined. The total number of river ships leaped from 58 in 2011 to
  182 in 2018, representing about 150% growth. <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>,
  in that same time period, grew about 30%, from 14 to 19 ships.</p>\n<p>It was a
  counterintuitive brag, but it provided a springboard to discussing the line’s differentiating
  <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/brand\">brand</a> factors. </p>\n<p>“In
  true luxury, you don’t rush the design,” Bettridge said. “You’re careful not to
  overpower the environment. You make sure you can continue to source local, fresh
  food along the rivers and offer unique, authentic experiences.</p>\n<p>Later, <a
  class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/tollman\">Tollman</a> told me, “You can’t
  be building ships on a conveyer belt, adding five to 10 a <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/year\">year</a>. Yes, we want to keep growing, but cautiously and prudently.
  There’s a bubble out there, and one day it will come <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/home\">home</a> to roost. We’re going to stay the course of thoughtful
  growth, and I couldn’t be happier.”</p>\n<p>This message has been embraced by his
  staff as a point of pride. </p>\n<p>“Nineteen ships, and no two are the same,” marketing
  vice <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/president\">president</a> Shirnett
  Fleet said of the <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/company\">company</a>‘s
  fleet. “People ask for renderings when we announce we’re working on a <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/new\">new</a> ship or transforming an existing ship, but they don’t
  exist — at least not right away. It’s an organic process. We’re building a <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/new\">new</a> ship for Egypt for 2020, and the design team is going
  through markets there, looking at how traditional hand woodcarving is done.&nbsp;This
  is not a computer doing renderings. The design is inspired by the destinations where
  we sail.”</p>\n<p>Fleet said that’s why <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>,
  in its videos, emphasizes the interiors more than exteriors. </p>\n<p>“Everyone
  uses a drone shot of their ship on the river in a beautiful location. We have something
  special, and it’s inside,” Fleet said.</p>\n<p>“And it doesn’t look like it’s from
  Ikea,” chimed in sales leader Anderson.</p>\n<p>Focus on staff</p>\n<p>One of the
  other differentiating points that <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>
  staff take pride in is that they are, in fact, staff. According to Bettridge, many
  of the positions filled by employees at <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>
  are typically contracted to third parties, such as river boat culinary staff. As
  employees, <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a> staff
  receive paid vacations and other benefits, as well as bonuses, including 1,000 euro
  payouts to the <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/parent\">parent</a> of a
  newborn. </p>\n<p>Anderson said that among the beneficiaries of retaining staff
  vs. hiring contractors are <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/travel\">travel</a>
  <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a>, whose clients
  are better served by happier service providers.</p>\n<p>It was also clear in conversations
  with staff that many of them take pride in working for the line that positions itself
  as the most luxurious, and their relations with guests are undoubtedly eased by
  the all-inclusive nature of <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>,
  which includes airport pickups, WiFi and gratuities in the sailing price. </p>\n<p>That
  price, of course, is generally higher than competitors’. <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/tollman\">Tollman</a> said the rate also reflects the higher costs that
  go into an employed staff, the fixtures, amenities and services such as butlers.
  </p>\n<p>“I understand that the average per-passenger daily cost in the industry
  is 38 euros, all-in. Ours is 120 euros,” he said. “We spend 27 million euros to
  build a ship; the others average 18 million.”</p>\n<p><a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/tollman\">Tollman</a> added with a smile. “We appreciate we’re not for
  everyone.”<br>While the majority of activities during the three-day Kickoff event
  could be categorized as training, it was just a slim majority of the time. For the
  balance, the focus was on social affairs: a ’70s-themed party, a formal dinner,
  a chef’s party and a black-tie gala.</p>\n<p>Two awards sessions were held. One,
  during the state-of-the-<a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/company\">company</a>
  presentation, recognized those who, nominated by peers, best represented one of
  the line’s 10 “guiding principles,” as spelled out in a business card-size, accordion-fold
  pamphlet distributed to all employees. The recipients represented the full range
  of departments: The award for “social, economic and environmental responsibility”
  went to a waitress, while the “<a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/health\">health</a>
  and safety awareness award” was given to a captain.</p>\n<p>The gala ball was held
  in nearby Cologne, Germany. <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/travel\">Travel</a>
  Corporation chairman Stanley <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/tollman\">Tollman</a>
  and his wife Bea, <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/president\">president</a>
  of portfolio <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/company\">company</a> Red
  Carnation Hotels, flew in for the event. Bea <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/tollman\">Tollman</a>,
  who along with daughter Toni <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/tollman\">Tollman</a>
  takes a large role in the design of the hotels and <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a> ships, also created many of the recipes served
  on the ships. </p>\n<p>Peer-nominated “Rising <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/star\">Star</a>”
  and “Best of” awards, each with a 1,000 euro stipend, were handed out in every department,
  with all of the recipients receiving a standing ovation.</p>\n<p>One recognition
  was offered posthumously. The line’s corporate executive chef, Mirko Peters, had
  died in November, and an award category was renamed in his honor. Earlier, bartenders
  had shared with me that a cocktail was added to the bar menu to keep his memory
  alive: The “Lemon, No Lime” refers to his favorite style of gin and tonic, and mixologists
  add a few drops of Aperol for color, plus a scoop of beer foam on top.</p>\n<p>Once
  all the honors were distributed and petit fours placed on the tables, a band, flown
  in from Paris for the occasion, provided a high-energy beat as attendees danced
  into the wee hours of the morning.</p>\n<p>Employee satisfaction seemed to filter
  upward, as well. Two executives told me, separately, that they were convinced they
  had the best job in the <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/world\">world</a>.
  One was Michelle Palma, vice <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/president\">president</a>
  field sales, North America. The other was Bettridge.</p>\n<p>Sharing intel on <a
  class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/face\">face</a> yoga and potato-based plastic</p>\n<p>The
  nights were for celebration, but the days were focused on intramural sharing of
  information.</p>\n<p>While those in sales and marketing have obvious reasons to
  learn about details, <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/new\">new</a> features
  and amenities for the coming season, Kickoff gave staffers from all areas an opportunity
  to get a 360-degree view of what goes on in the <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/company\">company</a>.</p>\n<p>After
  department-specific meetings concluded, representatives of each work group, from
  bartenders to maritime officers, were positioned at “fam stations” on five docked
  <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a> ships and were
  visited by roving groups of staff to learn about what was <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/new\">new</a> and different. Some teams had prepared video presentations,
  while others performed skits to get their points across.</p>\n<p>There were hands-on
  demonstrations: The <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/wellness\">wellness</a>
  team invited fellow staffers to join a “<a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/face\">face</a>
  yoga” session or get a hand <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/massage\">massage</a>
  or back rub. </p>\n<p>Chefs took over a large space to display and explain <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/new\">new</a> menu items, including vegan offerings, breakfast smoothies
  that won’t separate and the wonders produced by a Thermomix, a puree machine that
  blends sauces that <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/show\">show</a> up as
  smears, dots and lines on plates.</p>\n<p>Sommeliers showed off a bottle of wine
  they had blended and whose label displays all their signatures.</p>\n<p>One thing
  that impressed me while visiting the fam stations was how often the presentations
  reflected the corporate guiding principles. </p>\n<p>“Sustainability” (“We are dedicated
  to a safe and sustainable living and working environment”) was referenced by a chef
  who said the culinary staff had been able to source a biodegradable plastic made
  from potatoes that was suitable for wrapping and cooking food in a sous vide machine.</p>\n<p>A
  human resources officer (the department is called “People and Culture” at <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>) emphasized the “Guidance” principle, which
  states, “We thrive on clear structures, mutual trust and respectful cooperation,”
  before explaining a <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/new\">new</a> electronic
  timecard that keeps the <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/company\">company</a>
  in compliance with ever-changing European Union regulations.</p>\n<p>There was no
  station to educate staff about the role <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/travel\">travel</a>
  <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a> play in <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/uniworld\">Uniworld</a>‘s success, but at the state-of-the-<a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/company\">company</a> presentation, the full staff, from housekeepers
  to barbacks to bridge officers, also heard about the importance of agents.</p>\n<p>Bettridge,
  who began her career as a <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/travel\">travel</a>
  agent, flatly stated that <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a>
  were crucial to the business. That sentiment was echoed by <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/tollman\">Tollman</a>, who referenced <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a>
  as “vital to the current and future success of the <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/company\">company</a>.”</p>\n<p>I wondered if the significance of <a
  class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a> really had made an
  impression on other Kickoff attendees, so I asked about it during my informal roundtable.</p>\n<p>“Oh
  yes,” Queriaud said. “Everyone’s aware, because we all meet a lot of <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\"
  href=\"/tag/travel\">travel</a> <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a>
  onboard. The season begins on the 24th of March for the SS Joie de Vivre, and we
  have 24 <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a> onboard
  the night before.”</p>\n<p>It’s interesting that <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/advisors\">advisors</a>
  had a presence at Kickoff without actually being present. And, ironically, their
  powerful seat at the table found a potent <a class=\"oxarss_tag_link\" href=\"/tag/new\">new</a>
  symbol: an empty chair. </p>\n<div class=\"oxarss_original_link\">Google News: Wellness

  March, Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection holds \\\"Kickoff,\\\" a combination
  staff training\\/global sales conference\\/motivational retreat\\/family reunion.
  I attended the 2019 edition last week in Dusseldorf, Germany.This year, on the second
  evening of this business and social event, an auction was held to sell, piece by
  piece, artwork created by some of the 500 staff who were in attendance. The proce
  benefit a local hospital that provides services to children with terminal diseases.Sales
  manager Sheryl Garavelli paid 750 euros for a painting of a solitary chair. After
  taking possession of it, she walked over to Kristian Anderson, senior vice president
  of global sales, and handed it to him. The next morning, I asked him why.\\n\\\"The
  day before, at the start of our sales meeting, I had brought an empty chair onto
  the stage,\\\" Anderson told me. \\\"I said to the team that it would stay up there
  as a reminder of the person who wasn't present, but for whom we put in all of our
  time, energy and focus. It's the person who fuels our growth. The chair, I said,
  represents travel advisors. And now, that painting will be my own reminder to keep
  them always present.\\\"He told me another story about the importance of the people
  represented by that chair. Uniworld is an underwriter for the PBS program \\\"Amanpour
  \ Company,\\\" and he said there was a sticking point in the negotiations with the
  network.\\\"We had asked that the tagline include a phrase to the effect of, 'Contact
  your travel advisor to book your next Uniworld trip.' Believe it or not, they said
  no.\\\"It wasn't that the network is anti-travel agent, but their rules only allow
  the actual underwriter to be mentioned in a credit.\\\"We had to fight for a referral
  to advisors, and we were prepared to walk away if we didn't get it,\\\" Anderson
  said. \\\"In the end, we were able to work with their writers to come up with 'Bookings
  available through your travel advisor,' which worked within their guidelines.\\\"Too
  little water?Kickoff, Anderson told me, is the only time everyone gets together
  and reviews the successes and challenges of past year, where they are at moment
  and where they're heading. They review how to adapt to, and take advantage of, changing
  market conditions. A record number of passengers sailed in 2018, and growth is predicted
  for 2019, but success was uneven. \\\"Australia is in a slump. Latin America is
  doing well. The U.S. is stable,\\\" Anderson said. \\\"We know the election season
  could have a great impact on consumer demand, and also that we can get ahead of
  that now.\\\"While the meet-up was overwhelmingly upbeat, challenges were acknowledged.
  As a new season begins, Uniworld has at least one thing in common with all other
  operators on European rivers: fresh memories of record low water levels that resulted
  in disrupted -- or, in the industry's preferred terminology, \\\"deviated\\\" --
  departures. I was able to take advantage of Kickstart's concentration of management
  to hold an informal roundtable on that topic with Uniworld's director of nautical
  operations, Alexander Oost; its vice president, technical, Rolf Reachlan; its director
  of hotel operations, Yoke De Bruyn; and Jean-Marie Queriaud, director of operations
  in France.The extremes of last year's water deficit tested the industry and laid
  bare any weaknesses for all to see. In particular, the sector came under fire for
  under-communicating with guests and travel advisors.\\\"We were accustomed to a
  month or two of lower levels, but half a year?\\\" Oost said. \\\"We now have new
  policies in place. We can't control the weather, but we can control messaging. The
  client wants to be informed about potential problems as early as possible. Communication
  is key here.\\\"Part of the challenge lies in working with a global clientele. Even
  the best predictions of what's going to happen might not be timely enough for some
  guests, he said. \\\"An Australian would want to know about potential problems two
  weeks ahead of time, but our best predictions may be only one week out. And sometimes,
  those predictions are wrong.\\\"Queriad said that experiencing such an intense season
  of low water did improve the line's ability to anticipate issues and improve its
  predictive capabilities. It also improved decision-making processes about when to
  prepare to deviate or even cancel a sailing, which Uniworld did for the first time
  in 2018.Among the options they weigh are whether they can move a vessel with a shallower
  draft to an area where water levels might drop, Oost said.\\\"Deviation is a very
  costly exercise,\\\" Queriad added, citing the organization of motor coaches and
  securing hotel rooms. \\\"And even if you do all that right, a quarter of the guests
  will be dissatisfied.\\\"Oost said, \\\"No matter what you do and how carefully
  you explain everything, it's not always the right decision for every guest.\\\"A
  deviated or canceled voyage has an impact on staff as well as the guests, De Bruyn
  said. \\\"We know this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many people, and if
  they do not have the cruise they expect, everyone onboard also feels terrible,\\\"
  he said.Too many boats?Uniworld believes another industry challenge is overtourism
  on the rivers.\\\"It's a real threat,\\\" Brett Tollman, CEO of parent company the
  Travel Corporation, said in an interview. The industry, he said, has \\\"more than
  enough capacity on the rivers in Europe. You wake up in the morning and you see
  four, five, six boats tethered together, and at some point, a government is going
  to say, 'Enough!'. If you don't believe there's too much capacity, why are we seeing
  the two-for-one offers, or 75% off? What good is that for any company or for the
  industry?\\\"In the roundtable discussion, Reachlan said pushback to additional
  capacity is already coming from residents. The areas around ports have traditionally
  been attractive places to live, and too many boats make it less attractive.\\\"The
  nature of this business is intimacy,\\\" Queriad asserted. \\\"Unfortunately, three
  ships come into the same dock, and there are 12 buses waiting. People don't know
  which bus to join. It's not good for guests. It's not good for residents. Nobody
  wins.\\\"Current operational functions and infrastructure are under stress, Oost
  said. \\\"Some ports are saying we want to have you, but we already have too many
  ships,\\\" he said. \\\"You can build extra docks, but then you need extra coaches.
  You have to have a trained crew, and all that takes time.\\\"Still, Oost believes
  there's room for growth, as long as it's thoughtful growth. He and his team are
  looking at maps and calendars for lesser-known ports and days when fewer ships are
  present at popular stops. \\\"And you always look for new rivers, which present
  their own challenges because you're a pioneer,\\\" Oost said\\\"Thoughtful\\\" was
  a word that came up frequently at Uniworld's Kickstart. Charts projected by the
  line's CEO, Ellen Bettridge, during her \\\"state of the company\\\" address, showed
  how many fewer ships the company was adding than was true, on average, of the eight
  largest lines combined. The total number of river ships leaped from 58 in 2011 to
  182 in 2018, representing about 150% growth. Uniworld, in that same time period,
  grew about 30%, from 14 to 19 ships.It was a counterintuitive brag, but it provided
  a springboard to discussing the line's differentiating brand factors. \\\"In true
  luxury, you don't rush the design,\\\" Bettridge said. \\\"You're careful not to
  overpower the environment. You make sure you can continue to source local, fresh
  food along the rivers and offer unique, authentic experiences.Later, Tollman told
  me, \\\"You can't be building ships on a conveyer belt, adding five to 10 a year.
  Yes, we want to keep growing, but cautiously and prudently. There's a bubble out
  there, and one day it will come home to roost. We're going to stay the course of
  thoughtful growth, and I couldn't be happier.\\\"This message has been embraced
  by his staff as a point of pride. \\\"Nineteen ships, and no two are the same,\\\"
  marketing vice president Shirnett Fleet said of the company's fleet. \\\"People
  ask for renderings when we announce we're working on a new ship or transforming
  an existing ship, but they don't exist -- at least not right away. It's an organic
  process. We're building a new ship for Egypt for 2020, and the design team is going
  through markets there, looking at how traditional hand woodcarving is done.\\u00a0This
  is not a computer doing renderings. The design is inspired by the destinations where
  we sail.\\\"Fleet said that's why Uniworld, in its videos, emphasizes the interiors
  more than exteriors. \\\"Everyone uses a drone shot of their ship on the river in
  a beautiful location. We have something special, and it's inside,\\\" Fleet said.\\\"And
  it doesn't look like it's from Ikea,\\\" chimed in sales leader Anderson.Focus on
  staffOne of the other differentiating points that Uniworld staff take pride in is
  that they are, in fact, staff. According to Bettridge, many of the positions filled
  by employees at Uniworld are typically contracted to third parties, such as river
  boat culinary staff. As employees, Uniworld staff receive paid vacations and other
  benefits, as well as bonuses, including 1,000 euro payouts to the parent of a newborn.
  Anderson said that among the beneficiaries of retaining staff vs. hiring contractors
  are travel advisors, whose clients are better served by happier service providers.It
  was also clear in conversations with staff that many of them take pride in working
  for the line that positions itself as the most luxurious, and their relations with
  guests are undoubtedly eased by the all-inclusive nature of Uniworld, which includes
  airport pickups, WiFi and gratuities in the sailing price. That price, of course,
  is generally higher than competitors'. Tollman said the rate also reflects the higher
  costs that go into an employed staff, the fixtures, amenities and services such
  as butlers. \\\"I understand that the average per-passenger daily cost in the industry
  is 38 euros, all-in. Ours is 120 euros,\\\" he said. \\\"We spend 27 million euros
  to build a ship; the others average 18 million.\\\"Tollman added with a smile. \\\"We
  appreciate we're not for everyone.\\\"While the majority of activities during the
  three-day Kickoff event could be categorized as training, it was just a slim majority
  of the time. For the balance, the focus was on social affairs: a '70s-themed party,
  a formal dinner, a chef's party and a black-tie gala.Two awards sessions were held.
  One, during the state-of-the-company presentation, recognized those who, nominated
  by peers, best represented one of the line's 10 \\\"guiding principles,\\\" as spelled
  out in a business card-size, accordion-fold pamphlet distributed to all employees.
  The recipients represented the full range of departments: The award for \\\"social,
  economic and environmental responsibility\\\" went to a waitress, while the \\\"health
  and safety awareness award\\\" was given to a captain.The gala ball was held in
  nearby Cologne, Germany. Travel Corporation chairman Stanley Tollman and his wife
  Bea, president of portfolio company Red Carnation Hotels, flew in for the event.
  Bea Tollman, who along with daughter Toni Tollman takes a large role in the design
  of the hotels and Uniworld ships, also created many of the recipes served on the
  ships. Peer-nominated \\\"Rising Star\\\" and \\\"Best of\\\" awards, each with
  a 1,000 euro stipend, were handed out in every department, with all of the recipients
  receiving a standing ovation.One recognition was offered posthumously. The line's
  corporate executive chef, Mirko Peters, had died in November, and an award category
  was renamed in his honor. Earlier, bartenders had shared with me that a cocktail
  was added to the bar menu to keep his memory alive: The \\\"Lemon, No Lime\\\" refers
  to his favorite style of gin and tonic, and mixologists add a few drops of Aperol
  for color, plus a scoop of beer foam on top.Once all the honors were distributed
  and petit fours placed on the tables, a band, flown in from Paris for the occasion,
  provided a high-energy beat as attendees danced into the wee hours of the morning.Employee
  satisfaction seemed to filter upward, as well. Two executives told me, separately,
  that they were convinced they had the best job in the world. One was Michelle Palma,
  vice president field sales, North America. The other was Bettridge.Sharing intel
  on face yoga and potato-based plasticThe nights were for celebration, but the days
  were focused on intramural sharing of information.While those in sales and marketing
  have obvious reasons to learn about details, new features and amenities for the
  coming season, Kickoff gave staffers from all areas an opportunity to get a 360-degree
  view of what goes on in the company.After department-specific meetings concluded,
  representatives of each work group, from bartenders to maritime officers, were positioned
  at \\\"fam stations\\\" on five docked Uniworld ships and were visited by roving
  groups of staff to learn about what was new and different. Some teams had prepared
  video presentations, while others performed skits to get their points across.There
  were hands-on demonstrations: The wellness team invited fellow staffers to join
  a \\\"face yoga\\\" session or get a hand massage or back rub. Chefs took over a
  large space to display and explain new menu items, including vegan offerings, breakfast
  smoothies that won't separate and the wonders produced by a Thermomix, a puree machine
  that blends sauces that show up as smears, dots and lines on plates.Sommeliers showed
  off a bottle of wine they had blended and whose label displays all their signatures.One
  thing that impressed me while visiting the fam stations was how often the presentations
  reflected the corporate guiding principles. \\\"Sustainability\\\" (\\\"We are dedicated
  to a safe and sustainable living and working environment\\\") was referenced by
  a chef who said the culinary staff had been able to source a biodegradable plastic
  made from potatoes that was suitable for wrapping and cooking food in a sous vide
  machine.A human resources officer (the department is called \\\"People and Culture\\\"
  at Uniworld) emphasized the \\\"Guidance\\\" principle, which states, \\\"We thrive
  on clear structures, mutual trust and respectful cooperation,\\\" before explaining
  a new electronic timecard that keeps the company in compliance with ever-changing
  European Union regulations.There was no station to educate staff about the role
  travel advisors play in Uniworld's success, but at the state-of-the-company presentation,
  the full staff, from housekeepers to barbacks to bridge officers, also heard about
  the importance of agents.Bettridge, who began her career as a travel agent, flatly
  stated that advisors were crucial to the business. That sentiment was echoed by
  Tollman, who referenced advisors as \\\"vital to the current and future success
  of the company.\\\"I wondered if the significance of advisors really had made an
  impression on other Kickoff attendees, so I asked about it during my informal roundtable.\\\"Oh
  yes,\\\" Queriaud said. \\\"Everyone's aware, because we all meet a lot of travel
  advisors onboard. The season begins on the 24th of March for the SS Joie de Vivre,
  and we have 24 advisors onboard the night before.\\\"It's interesting that advisors
  had a presence at Kickoff without actually being present. And, ironically, their
  powerful seat at the table found a potent new symbol: an empty chair. Google News:
