  was a fairly <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-in-2018\">quiet year for
  AMD’s graphics department</a> in 2018, but now that AMD has released the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amd-radeon-vii\">Radeon
  VII</a> graphics card for gaming, 2019 is the year of the 7nm GPU.&nbsp;</p><p>We
  were left waiting for a new AMD graphics card for quite a long time, but the Radeon
  VII managed to put AMD back on the map. Thanks to the new 7nm GPU architecture,
  AMD was able to pack its latest graphics card with more transistors than ever before,
  without increasing the power draw.</p><p>Priced the same as the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080\">Nvidia
  GeForce RTX 2080</a>, while delivering comparable performance – albeit without <a
  href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-turing\">Nvidia Turing’s</a> ray tracing
  or DLSS features – 2019 is an exciting year for the best graphics cards.</p><p>While
  the Radeon VII seems to be at least tangentially related to Vega, but it hasn’t
  been confirmed whether or not it’ll officially be a part of the Vega II family –
  if the Vega II family will even exist. Based on what we were hearing before AMD
  pulled up the curtains, the Radeon VII lines up well with what we were expecting,
  so for now we’ll be treating AMD’s latest GPU as a Vega II part, even if it’s not
  official.</p><p>So, be sure to keep this page bookmarked, and we’ll dive into everything
  there is to know about AMD Vega II.&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Cut to the chase</h3>  <ul><li><strong>What
  is it? </strong>AMD’s first 7nm consumer graphics cards</li><li><strong>When is
  it out?</strong> February 7, 2019</li><li><strong>What will it cost?</strong> $699
  (about £550, AU$980)</li></ul>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" alt=\"AMD Vega

  CES 2019, AMD announced the Radeon VII, the first 7nm consumer graphics card. Launching
  on February 7, 2019, what we believe to be the first of the Vega II graphics cards
  arrived with Devil May Cry V, Resident Evil 2 and The Division 2. However, if you
  want to get your hands on this card, you might want to act fast – <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amds-navi-graphics-cards-may-not-arrive-until-october\">AMD’s
  Navi cards may not show up until October</a>, and the Radeon VII is out of stock
  at many retailers.</p><p>Whether availability is going to be an issue remains to
  be seen, but we’ll be sure to update this article with whatever information comes
  out.&nbsp;</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" alt=\"AMD Vega II\" fullscreen=\"\"
  id=\"7xitux35Z58WDTvo5sMgs\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/FadtQAbLzNnJgYwkyPxVxsNPHyBlApRNSJuyT-BJALvm1kpf0K9DsV5qJNyDtG8zjRXrSomEHO4oZm3-vBFIgGyfDRAZzusCkldab6yk=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>Image
  Credit: AMD</p></figcaption></figure>  <h3>AMD Vega II price</h3>  <p>Right now
  there’s only one AMD Vega II card, the Radeon VII, and that has launched at $699
  (£649, AU$1,109), bundled with three games. We’re sure that AMD will fill out the
  product stack with lower priced GPUs in the future, but we don’t know what the pricing
  will look like quite yet. However, you can probably assume it’s going to compete
  with <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-turing\">Nvidia’s Turing</a>
  product stack directly.&nbsp;</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" alt=\"AMD Vega
  II\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"QEPKbjbbeXhwABagcCBRqQ\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Wf9oRoqxm2WMZspOAjq6tx_W-V0gDovk8fbKt0Yfw_x0kNTVmtXVr37omiYfbTcGuXZg2Pg4YpBEBdsqWtInbqN1LzjC0KzeY76dEfap9Q=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>Image
  Credit: TechRadar</p></figcaption></figure>  <h3>AMD Vega II specs</h3>  <p>The
  switch from a 14nm process to a 7nm process allows AMD to pack even more power into
  each GPU. For its graphics cards, this move means more transistors in each GPU without
  having to increase the die size or the power requirements.</p><p>And, the AMD Radeon
  VII is the fist 7nm graphics card for gamers, with 3,840 stream processors, 16GB
  HBM2 VRAM and 1TB/s of memory bandwidth. This goes directly against the Nvidia GeForce
  RTX 2080, which has 2,944 CUDA cores, 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM and 448GB/s of memory bandwidth.&nbsp;</p><p>The
  Radeon VII will definitely outperform its competitor in some workloads thanks to
  sheer horsepower. But, it’s especially going to shine in creative workloads, meaning
  that it’s going to be the best graphics card for hobbyist video editors and content
  creators who don’t have the cash to drop on a professional product.</p><p>But, the
  AMD Radeon VII won’t offer the double-precision capabilities that the enterprise
  Radeon MI60 does, according to <a href=\"https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/283805-amd-radeon-vii-wont-offer-full-speed-double-precision\"
  rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ExtremeTech</a>, so it’s still very much a consumer
  graphics card.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from standalone cards, it seems all but guaranteed
  that the Vega II series will find its way into mobile and lower-power devices as
  integrated graphics processors. With a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-3000-next-generation-16-core-processors-leaked\">new
  generation of Ryzen processors</a> expected, a new generation of Vega graphics to
  integrate into APUs is only fitting.</p><p>In fact, laptops will soon see a flurry
  of <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-2nd-gen-ryzen-mobile-processors-aim-to-take-over-the-laptop-scene\">2nd
  Gen Ryzen Mobile processors</a> equipped with brand new Vega graphics. &nbsp;time.
  Even the anticipated <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/xbox-streaming-console-leak-reveals-next-gen-amd-processor\">Xbox
  Scarlet Cloud could see Vega II</a> built into its APU. &nbsp;</p>  <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3rd-generation\">AMD
  Ryzen 3rd Generation</a> could introduce the very first 7nm processors</li></ul><p>This

  that AMD has revealed its first 7nm consumer graphics card, the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-radeon-vii\">Radeon
  VII</a>, it’s about time for Team Red to reveal its other 7nm GPU architecture,
  Navi.</p><p>We have seen rumors that suggest AMD Navi won’t immediately occupy the
  high end of the market – even if it may include <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-could-be-working-on-variable-rate-shading-for-its-navi-graphics-cards\">similar
  variable rate shading</a> to <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-turing\">Nvidia
  Turing</a>. Instead, AMD Navi looks like it’ll occupy the mid range at first, along
  with the rumor of a GPU designed for the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ps5-and-next-xbox-may-feature-this-cutting-edge-amd-chip\">next
  generation of consoles</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, before we start exploring all the juicy
  gossip, speculation and even some official information, consider that nothing is
  set in stone yet. Still, you should keep this page bookmarked, as we’ll update it
  as soon as we hear anything new.</p>  <h3>Cut to the Chase</h3>  <ul><li><strong>What
  is it? </strong>AMD's next-generation 7nm GPU architecture</li><li><strong>When
  is it out?</strong> 2018</li><li><strong>What will it cost?</strong> Pricing remains
  yet to be confirmed</li></ul>  <a target=\"_blank\"><figure><p><img align=\"middle\"

  now, the only official proof that Navi will be launch anytime soon is a small statement
  from AMD titled “<a href=\"https://community.amd.com/community/amd-corporate/blog/2018/08/27/expanding-our-high-performance-leadership-with-focused-7nm-development\">Expanding
  our High-Performance Leadership with Focused 7nm Development</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>In
  the release, AMD Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster states that “We have
  already tapped out multiple 7nm products at TSMC, including our first 7nm GPU planned
  to launch later this year and our first 7nm server CPU that we plan to launch in
  2019.”</p><p>Unfortunately, even with that statement we don’t really have a full
  picture of when or how AMD Navi is going to hit the market. Especially when the
  only 7nm GPUs have been the Radeon Instinct cards for workstations, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-vega-ii\">Vega
  II</a> and the AMD Radeon VII – a high-end part tapped to compete with the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080\">RTX
  2080</a>.</p><p>A lot of the speculation right now revolves around Navi being designed
  to power the next generation of game consoles, with gaming <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/best-graphics-cards-1291458\">graphics
  cards</a> to follow later.&nbsp;</p><p>This all comes from that leaked roadmap we
  mentioned earlier, which suggests that AMD Navi will show up in the second half
  of 2019. However, the entire line probably won’t make an appearance at the same
  time. Instead, the cards that will likely show up in 2019 will be more mid-range
  products for budget-minded gamers with full-fat enthusiast grade 7nm cards showing
  up as late as 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>This all comes from a leaked benchmark, however,
  but it would seem to fall in line with when we can expect the next generation of
  consoles – late 2019/early 2020. And, recent leaks that point to <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amds-navi-graphics-cards-may-not-arrive-until-october\">AMD
  Navi launching in October 2019</a> seem to back up that speculation.</p><p>But,
  we’ve seen other rumors that suggest Navi will show up much earlier. We’ve seen
  speculation that AMD may end up launching Navi alongside Ryzen 3rd Generation processors
  at <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-may-launch-7nm-ryzen-processors-and-navi-graphics-cards-this-july\">Computex
  2019 in July</a>. That is still <em>technically</em> the second half of 2019, but
  it does seem a bit early. We’d advise taking that with a grain of salt.</p><p>AMD
  Navi also may come in laptops and even the next line of MacBooks if <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-navi-graphics-card-references-in-macos-suggest-july-launch\">newly
  found code</a> in <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/macos-1014\">macOS Mojave</a>
  is to be believed. These Navi-powered MacBooks are rumored to arrive in July, which
  would follow just a month after the &nbsp;purported debut of next-gen consoles.</p><p>Either
  way, we know that AMD Navi is coming, we’ve even seen rumors about Navi’s follow-up,
  called Arcturus, according to a report from <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/amd-arcturus-7nm-next-gen-gpu-revealed/\">Wccftech</a>.
  It seems like AMD has a lot of stuff coming out in the next few years, we just have
  to wait to see what happens. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\"

  last decade or so, AMD has essentially built a name for itself in the GPU space
  as the budget king. And, as Nvidia gets ready to release its next generation of
  <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-turing\"><u>Turing</u></a> RTX graphics
  cards that cost upwards of a thousand bucks, AMD will probably double down on this
  – just like it released <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-release-date-news-and-features-everything-you-need-to-know\"><u>Ryzen</u></a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-9-release-date-news-and-rumors-everything-you-need-to-know\"><u>Ryzen
  Threadripper</u></a> to counter Intel.</p><p>As for the exact pricing, we’re not
  entirely sure, but we expect the pricing to follow in line with the Radeon RX 500
  series. Those prices are below.</p>  <ul><li><strong>AMD Radeon RX 550</strong>
  - $114 (£99, AU$104)</li><li><strong>AMD Radeon RX 560</strong> - $139 (£140, AU$235)</li><li><strong>AMD
  Radeon RX 570</strong> - $280 (£250, AU$340)</li><li><strong>AMD Radeon RX 580</strong>
  - $289 (£289, AU$450)</li></ul>  <p>We can expect the prices to go up, however,
  due to the likely inclusion of GDDR6 memory, which we’ll dive into later. Either
  way, expect to pay more for the Radeon RX 650.</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\"
  alt=\"AMD Navi\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"KqHtTFGGLsoceUy83wXYBZ\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/6aW7vR7UZb5cEnu3Ub4vfi6--w8TuEd4HfOJZzhI0d1DELmCLw6cKQaCeT3eS4BtqjOXFzhnOItEUcaYRrQaf7PgWxZCIMpPZwkSziZXsQ=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>Image
  Credit: AMD</p></figcaption></figure>  <h3>AMD Navi specs</h3>  <p>Beyond the rumor
  that it’s going to be running on a 7nm process and GDDR6, there’s not much we know
  about AMD Navi. Because AMD Navi is going to be the <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/exclusive-amd-navi-gpu-roadmap-cost-zen/\"><u>first
  mainstream GPU processor to break away from the GCN architecture</u></a>, we could
  see more shaders and and faster clock speeds, while improving efficiency substantially.</p><p>However,
  we don’t think AMD is going to be doing much to compete on the high-end with Nvidia
  this time around. AMD Vega 7nm, which would have the horsepower to compete with
  Nvidia Turing, won’t be coming to gamers. Instead, it will likely appeal more towards
  professionals and creatives – with Apple likely being a huge customer.&nbsp;</p><p>In
  the past AMD would compete with high-end Nvidia GPUs by just shoving multiple chips
  into a graphics cards and passing it along as a enthusiast-grade GPU. This time
  around, though, AMD has made it clear that it’s not interested in making multi-GPU
  setups, according to a report from <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/3281386/components-graphics/amd-next-gen-radeon-navi-gpu-multi-chip.html\"><u>PCWorld</u></a>.
  This is backed up by the fact that only two of the AMD Radeon RX 500 series cards
  were even compatible with Crossfire.&nbsp;</p><p>So, instead of any high-end GPU,
  we’ll likely see a Radeon RX 600 series that’ll continue the legacy of cards like
  the AMD Radeon RX 580, delivering respectable performance in modern titles at 1080p
  while keeping prices attainable for more budget-conscious gamers. So instead of
  the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-ti\"><u>Nvidia
  GeForce RTX 2080 Ti</u></a> rival, think more Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 in terms of
  direct competition.</p><p>Unfortunately, we’re going to have to keep waiting for
  concrete information on AMD Navi. But, until then, keep this page bookmarked for
  all the latest news, rumors and speculation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This

  that AMD has revealed its its first 7nm <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-3rd-generation\">Ryzen
  3rd Generation</a> processors, what will the future look like for Threadripper 3rd

  Zen 2</a> architecture at <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/ces-2019\">CES

  Generation release date</h3>  <p>AMD hasn’t come out and announced the release date
  for the next Threadripper chips, but the last two generations have had pretty consistent
  release dates, so we have a solid basis for speculation.</p><p>Both the original
  <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-9-release-date-news-and-rumors-everything-you-need-to-know\">Threadripper</a>
  and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-threadripper-2nd-generation\">Threadripper
  2nd Generation</a> launched in August of 2017 and 2018, respectively. We’re fairly
  sure that AMD is going to follow the same general release schedule this time around,
  but, obviously we don’t know that for sure.&nbsp;</p><p>The Zen 2 architecture will
  launch in mid 2019, likely in Q2 or Q3, in the form of consumer-focused Ryzen chips.
  Right now, the rumors are <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-may-launch-7nm-ryzen-processors-and-navi-graphics-cards-this-july\">pointing
  to a July release date</a> for the consumer-focused Ryzen 3rd Generation chips.
  But, we still don’t have any clue about when we could expect Threadripper, but it’s
  safe to assume it will at least be teased at Computex 2019, with a release in the
  late summer or early Autumn.</p><p>We’ll update this article as soon as we hear
  more substantial rumors about the release date.</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\"

  Generation price</h3>  <p>Now, so far ahead of AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3rd Generation’s
  launch, we don’t have any official pricing information, but we can look at past
  generations to get an idea of what AMD’s next HEDT chips will cost.&nbsp;</p><p>The
  original lineup of Threadripper topped out with the $999 (£999, AU$1,439) AMD Ryzen
  Threadripper 1950X, but the second generation introduced surprisingly lower priced
  replacements. There were also two higher specced – and higher priced – additions.
  We believe Threadripper 3rd Generation will follow the latter model.</p><p>The prices
  of AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2nd Generation chips are as follows:&nbsp;</p>  <ul><li><strong>Ryzen
  Threadripper 2990WX:</strong> $1,799 (£1,639, AU$2,679)</li><li><strong>Ryzen Threadripper
  2970WX:</strong> $1,299 (£1,159, AU$2,039)</li><li><strong>Ryzen Threadripper 2950X:</strong>
  $899 (£809, AU$1,415)</li><li><strong>Ryzen Threadripper 2920X:</strong> $649 (£583,
  AU$1,019)</li></ul>  <p>AMD could very well surprise us and introduce an even higher-end
  SKU, but we don’t think that’s likely. Stay tuned, and we’ll update this page as
  soon as we hear any Threadripper 3rd Generation price information.</p>  <figure><p><img

  Credit: TechRadar&nbsp;</p></figcaption></figure>  <h3>AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3rd
  Generation specs</h3>  <p>With AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3rd Generation, we expect
  to see a huge bump in core counts, efficiency and per-core performance with Threadripper
  3rd Generation. If you need a refresher on last year’s Threadripper lineup’s specs
  they’re as follows:</p>  <ul><li><strong>Ryzen Threadripper 2920X: </strong>12-cores,
  24-threads, clocked at 3.5GHz to 4.3GHz</li><li><strong>Ryzen Threadripper 2950X:</strong>
  16-cores, 32-threads, clocked at 3.5GHz to 4.4GHz</li><li><strong>Ryzen Threadripper
  2970WX:</strong> 24-cores, 48-threads, clocked at 3.0GHz to 4.2GHz</li><li><strong>Ryzen
  Threadripper 2990WX:</strong> 32-cores, 64-threads, clocked at 3.0GHz to 4.2GHz</li></ul>
  \ <p>We’re sure that with the move to 7nm, AMD is going to massively improve specs.
  But, with Threadripper 3rd Generation, or <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-threadripper-plans-until-2020-revealed-in-leaks\">Castle
  Peak</a>, rumors are thin on the ground. However, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-3000-next-generation-16-core-processors-leaked\">there
  is plenty of buzz</a> about the AMD Ryzen 3000 series, not to mention the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/leak-shows-amds-64-core-epyc-processor-blowing-away-intels-xeon-cpus\">64-core
  AMD Epyc server CPU</a>.</p><p>While we’ve seen speculation that suggests a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-zen-2-could-be-five-times-better-than-ryzen-2nd-generation-cpus\">16-core
  Ryzen 3000 processor</a>, that hasn’t been confirmed. What <em>has </em>been confirmed,
  though, is a new 8-core Ryzen processor that matches the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-9900k-review\">Intel
  Core i9-9900K</a>’s Cinebench score, getting 2,023 points.</p><p>AMD also showed
  off the system power in its test, the whole system ran at just 130W during the Cinebench
  run, compared to the Intel system’s 180W. We don’t know what frequency this chip
  was running at, but this high performance combined with the high efficiency is promising
  for whatever Threadripper chips come from Zen 2.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, the chip
  AMD showed off revealed that 8-core chiplets are smaller than the IO die. What this
  means for Threadripper is many more cores in the same amount of space. It’s possible
  that we could see a 64-core Threadripper chip in 2019.</p><p>It wouldn’t even be
  the first 64-core processor in AMD’s lineup. AMD recently showed off its latest
  <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-reveals-most-powerful-data-centre-chips-and-aws-partnership\">Epyc
  processors, based off its Rome microarchitecture</a>, with up to 64-cores.&nbsp;</p><p>If
  AMD is able to bring those high core counts to Castle Peak HEDT processors, we could
  see AMD absolutely dominate <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-basin-falls-refresh\">Intel’s
  Basin Falls Refresh</a>. And, if Intel can’t answer with anything but 14nm silicon,
  AMD might claim the HEDT throne like it did when it topped Intel’s mainstream sales.</p>

  UK businesses according to new research from <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/the-worlds-first-public-trial-of-5g-has-been-switched-on-in-australia\">Telstra</a>.</p><p>The

  target=\"_blank\">Disruptive Decision-Making white paper</a> was compiled using
  responses from 3,810 senior decision-makers from 12 industries in 14 markets worldwide
  to uncover insights into the strengths and weaknesses of businesses' digital transformation
  programs.</p><p>When rating decision-making across four factors for success (people,
  processes, technology understanding and partnerships), British businesses ranked
  'technology understanding' as the area in which they were most confident.</p>  <ul><li>Getting

  percent felt their organization makes technology decision 'well' or 'extremely well'.</p>
  \ <h3>Technology-enabled but people-led</h3>  <p>Telstra's Managing Director for
  EMEA Tom Homer explained that digitally mature organizations show greater focus
  on people and processes, saying:</p><p>“I believe that digital transformation is
  technology-enabled, but people-led. Yet our research shows employees are not being
  given the attention they warrant. Successful digital transformation relies on more
  than the right technology. It requires the right culture, the right people and the
  right processes to support them. Digital transformation should be a company journey
  that involves upskilling and changing employee mindsets, adapting structures and
  ways of working, and creating teams that can maximise the new technologies being
  introduced.”</p><p>When it came to successful digital transformation projects, Telstra's
  research found that a company-wide approach is significantly more likely to result
  in success. However, 53 percent of UK organizations allow business departments to
  drive individual digital initiatives instead of the whole company.</p><p>Organizations
  also rated their top three digital transformation priorities as optimizing technology
  to move faster, managing risk and compliance and protecting digital assets from
  cyber threats.</p><p>Digital transformation spending is also on the rise with a
  quarter (25%) of UK businesses investing more than one million in digital transformation
  products and services over the past year. This number is set to increase as 24 percent
  of respondents said their company's digital transformation spending would grow by
  more than ten percent in the next three years.</p>  <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-the-iot-everything-you-need-to-know\">This

  \ <p>Corsair is one of the most trusted names when it comes to the best RAM on the
  market. Its Vengeance series, especially, has something for everyone with its LED
  DDR4 offerings. On top of giving PC builders that extra touch of vibrant lighting,
  this RAM has robust heat spreaders that maximise cooling for higher overclocking
  and maximum performance. Corsair’s Vengeance LED DDR4 series also features CL16
  latency and whopping 3,466 MHz speeds, so it’s just as fast and responsive as it
  is aesthetic.</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"Vqoha9GFY6krezcWbon7oa\"

  RGB</h3>  <p>At this point, everyone kind of knows about G. Skill and its Trident
  Z RGB series of RAM. This is some of the best RAM not just because it’s fast, but
  the top of every DIMM features a full-spectrum rainbow wave light bar that you can
  use to match your RGB lighting across your entire system. Trident Z RGB DDR4 RAM
  features CAS latencies between 14 and 19 which is awesome enough, but with speeds
  up to 4,266, it’s almost perfect. No matter your aesthetic, it’s hard to argue with
  the G. Skill TridentZ RGB as the best RGB RAM.</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\"

  empty your wallet. This smart DDR3 or DDR4 RAM auto-detects system components to
  overclock to the highest speeds possible, optimizing performance for all of Intel’s
  latest chipsets. It comes with latencies between CL14 and CL16, and has speeds between
  2,133 and 2,666MHz. While it’s inexpensive, it really can have a huge impact on
  the performance of your rig.&nbsp;</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\"

  Platinum RGB</h3>  <p>If you want the best of the best, and you don’t care about
  pricing, Corsair’s Dominator Platinum memory has always been at the top of the list.
  However, in 2019, it’s been refreshed to include Corsair’s new Capellix RGB LEDs,
  leading to a much richer and more colorful design. It’s the same high-end RAM we
  know and love, with speeds up to 3,600 MHz, but the better RGB make the Corsair
  Dominator Platinum RGB the best RAM around in 2019.&nbsp;</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\"

  Trident Z RGB DC</h3>  <p>Sometimes, especially when you’re looking for the best
  gaming components, ‘go big or go home’ is the best advice. And, when you want more
  RAM than you’ll know what to do with, you’re going to want to go with the G.Skill
  Trident Z RGB DC memory. The DC stands for double capacity, as in, &nbsp;32GB per
  stick. Now, this is definitely not the fastest memory in the world, right now it’s
  only available in up to 3,200 MHz, but if you need a lot of RAM without taking up
  too many DIMM slots (like if you have a big CPU cooler or a Mini-ITX board), you
  can’t go wrong with the G.Skill TridentZ RGB DC.</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\"

  \ <p>If you’re going for an all-out no-holds-barred build, and you want the flashiest
  hardware so that your desktop can illuminate your office, you’re going to want the
  Adata Spectrix D80. Not only is it available in frequencies up to 5,000MHz, but
  it’s liquid-cooled, which means you shouldn’t ever have to worry about it overheating
  on you. The Adata Spectrix D80 is going to be the best RAM for gaming in an RGB-lit
  cavern.&nbsp;</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"3sj4Ea9z79cFyDbSXQuJKE\"

  RGB</h3>  <p>HyperX has always been a huge name in desktop memory, and it’s not
  hard to see why. The DIMMs they release always feature the latest technologies without
  pushing the price higher than it really needs to be – and the HyperX Predator DDR4
  RGB is yet another example. Not only is this ram fast, but it looks good, too –
  with Infrared Sync tech that promises to actually synchronize the lighting between
  DIMMs. And, with its stylish black heat spreaders, this is the best RAM if you want
  your gaming PC to reach max aesthetic.</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\"

  LPX</h3>  <p>Corsair’s Vengeance LPX RAM is made for users who want the maximum
  performance with minimum footprint. This low-profile RAM is essential for PC builds
  with massive CPU coolers. Despite being so low-profile, they still feature an eight-layer
  heat spreader to cool while overclocking. While its thin design doesn’t allow for
  LEDs, but you can get it in three colors: black, red or blue. &nbsp;</p>  <figure><p><img

  \ <p>Just like their dedication to laptop and desktop RAM, G.Skill has RAM upgrades
  for Macs, too. Adding more memory on the Apple Store is needlessly expensive, so
  going with a third-party kit can help you save a ton of money – assuming that your
  machine is one the last remaining MacBooks or iMacs that are still upgradable. These
  SO-DIMM have a CAS latency between 9 and 11 and have between 1,333MHz and 1,600MHz.
  The best bang for the buck seems to be the G.Skill DDR3-1333 for Mac.</p>  <figure><p><img

  up, the idea of bringing a TV outside was something we had always wanted but were
  never allowed to do. Now that we find ourselves in the positions of our parents,
  it’s easy to understand why: TVs just aren’t meant to be outside ... unless, of
  course, they’re specifically designed to be there.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s more or less
  the M.O. for SunBriteTV, a maker of all-weather LED-LCD TVs that’s based in Thousand
  Oaks, California. They design TVs to withstand the elements and last outdoors all
  year long. It’s an interesting premise, certainly, and one that proves to be useful
  in more situations than you might expect.</p><p>We’ll cover what it’s like to buy
  one in the section below, but first let’s talk about how SunBriteTV’s series stack
  up.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important thing to know is that SunBriteTV offers three
  series - Veranda, Signature and Pro - that correspond to where the TV is going to
  sit on your outdoor patio, deck or mounted to the side of your house.&nbsp;</p><p><em>[Update:
  New for 2019, SunBriteTV is releasing a 75-inch version of the Veranda Series. Like
  the 43-, 55- and 65-inch versions, the TV will offer 4K HDR support and uses a direct-lit
  400-nit panel. The TV will set you back $4,999, and is available now.]</em></p>

  Credit: SunBriteTV</p></figcaption></figure>  <h3>SunBriteTV Veranda Series&nbsp;</h3>
  \ <p>Rather than create a good, better and best series like other manufacturers,
  SunBrite’s lineup starts with the full shade Veranda Series.&nbsp;</p><p>This is
  the kind of TV that still sits outside, but should ideally be in the shade most
  of the time. According to SunBrite, the Veranda Series is about 50% brighter than
  your run-of-the-mill LED-LCD from Samsung, LG or Sony, but that’s still not bright
  enough to resist the dulling effects or glare that occur when a TV sits in direct
  sunlight.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of resolution, all models the Veranda series supports
  4K while the 55-inch model supports both 4K and HDR. The series comes in four screen
  sizes (43-, 55-, 65- and 75-inches) all of which are cheaper than an equivalent
  sized screen in the Signature or Pro series. Like the other series, the Veranda
  Series includes a weatherproof remote and weatherproof bay for a streaming player
  like the Roku Premiere, Chromecast or Amazon Fire TV Stick.&nbsp;</p>  <figure><p><img

  Credit: SunBriteTV</p></figcaption></figure>  <h3>SunBriteTV Signature Series&nbsp;</h3>
  \ <p>SunBriteTV’s Signature Series serves a slightly different purpose: it’s designed
  to sit in places that fluctuate between full sun and full shade, ideally in a spot
  that’s partially sunny in the times that you’d be outside watching TV.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike
  the Veranda Series, none of SunBrite’s Signature Series have HDR - an important
  consideration if you’re a cinephile - but, that said, the Signature Series is brighter
  than the Veranda Series and up to three times as bright as traditional LED-LCD screens
  from Samsung, Sony and LG.&nbsp;</p><p>The trade-off here is that the Signature
  Series is more expensive: the 43-inch model starts at $2,799 and the 65-inch model
  will set you back nearly $8,000.</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" alt=\"SunBriteTV\"

  Credit: SunBriteTV</p></figcaption></figure>  <h3>SunBriteTV Pro Series&nbsp;</h3>
  \ <p>Last but not least is the SunBriteTV Pro Series, which, oddly enough, doesn’t
  feature 4K at all. How it gets its Pro name isn’t necessarily based on the picture
  quality, but rather, because it features an impact-resistant glass screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Like
  the Signature Series, the Pro Series is outstandingly bright (around 1,000 nits
  according to SunBrite) and ready for whatever the outdoors has to throw at it. It’s
  designed to sit in direct sunlight areas and is UV-resistant so performance won’t
  diminish over time.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of audio quality, while the two other series
  use 20-watt down-firing speakers, the Pro Series ups the ante to a separate, detachable
  speaker bar.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pro Series comes in four screen sizes from 32- up to
  55-inches and range in price from $3,295 on the low-end to almost $6,000 on the
  55-inch SB-5518HD.&nbsp;</p>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"9e2yTDwSDPTT2XdfvTKgTm\"

  \ <p>If you frequently host soirees, own a hot tub where you want some extra entertainment
  or plan on spending a time outside during warm summer nights, a SunBriteTV is pretty
  much the only brand of TVs we’d recommend.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, even in relatively
  enclosed spaces that are still subject to excessive moisture or heat, we’d recommend
  a SunBriteTV as well. This might be a downstairs basement, partially enclosed sun
  room or garage, all of which would benefit from a little extra protection in case
  temperatures fluctuate.&nbsp;</p><p>If there are drawbacks to the SunBriteTV lineup
  it’s that AV enthusiasts might be nonplussed by the omission of HDR in all but one
  of the models, and budget buyers probably won’t be able to afford much more than
  the 32- or 43-inch TV. At around $6,000 and up, it’s prohibitively expensive to
  buy anything bigger than 55-inch screen unless you’re looking to outfit a business
  or decorate a high-end property for a sale.&nbsp;</p><p>SunBriteTV’s biggest selling
  point is the peace of mind you get by buying a TV that was designed for the outdoors.
  You’ll know that it can resist the elements (SunBriteTV claims they'll work at temperatures
  from -40 F up to 122 degrees), and was designed to be bright enough to overcome
  direct sunlight and glare - two things that indoor TVs were just never designed
  to do. That comes at a price, obviously, but for those willing to pay a bit more,
  it’s one that feels justified.</p>  <ul><li>Looking for the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/best-tv-us\">best

  is drawing additional controversy over its Research Program, that <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/facebook-paid-users-to-install-a-vpn-that-spies-on-them\">collected
  data on teens</a> through its <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/facebook-shutters-onavo-vpn-app\">Onavo
  VPN app</a>, now that <em>TechCrunch</em> has revealed that the social networking
  giant misreported the number of users in the program.</p><p>When the news initially
  broke, the company said that “Less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate
  in this market research program were teens”. However, this has been proven to be
  incorrect thanks to Facebook's responses to a letter from US Senator Mark Warner
  on the issue.</p><p>The senator wrote to CEO Mark Zuckberg about how its Research
  Program specifically targeted teens and their mobile data usage which it obtained
  by paying users to install a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn\">VPN</a>
  which spied on them.</p>  <ul><li>Facebook shutters <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/facebook-shutters-onavo-vpn-app\">Onavo

  data collection on its users</a></li></ul>  <p>Facebook's VP of US public policy
  Kevin Martin responded to the senator's questions, saying:</p><p>“At the time we
  ended the Facebook Research App on Apple’s iOS platform, less than 5 percent of
  the people sharing data with us through this program were teens.&nbsp;Analysis shows
  that number is about 18 percent when you look at the complete lifetime of the program,
  and also add people who had become inactive and uninstalled the app.”&nbsp;</p>
  \ <h3>Controversial cover up</h3>  <p>Basically Facebook provided the media with
  the percentage of teens in its Research Program when <em>TechCrunch</em> first discovered
  it as opposed to the total percentage of teens who had been involved throughout
  the lifespan of the program.</p><p>The social network faced further scrutiny when
  Senator Martin grilled them on the issue of parental consent forms. According to
  Facebook, all participants under 18 signed parental consent forms when first joining
  the program but in reality the teens who participated just had to check a box to
  claim that they had parental consent which is quite different from how it first
  explained the registration process.</p><p>So to recap, in addition to lying about
  the nature of its Research Program to begin with, the company also knowingly targeted
  teens without their parents' permission.</p><p>At a time when Facebook is still
  dealing with the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/facebook-hit-with-pound500000-fine-following-cambridge-analytica-scandal\">Cambridge
  Analytica</a> scandal and was recently <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/facebook-slammed-by-uk-government\">slammed
  by the UK government</a>, the company will likely have to address its Research Program
  formally to show regulators and consumers alike that it should be trusted with user
  data at all.</p><p>Via <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/facebook-research-teens/\"

  and elicit emotion through a variety of other means; musical score, imagery, color
  palate, facial expression - the possibilities are endless. And, often, stories are
  all the more powerful for not resorting to words. As the old screenwriting adage
  goes: show don’t tell.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of this, we've put together a list of
  eight video games that tell a captivating story and immerse us in their worlds without
  the use of a single spoken word.</p>  <h3>RiME</h3>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\"
  fullscreen=\"\" id=\"FGeCNxxJcpC6Eug28Q9bXX\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/1VKTkqNxRJ3ttbhFjNws91cyQv7tYkeNP-WYCzIJKwmQVj0mS570IcZqWRs9yY95Wq2nscldqfiT7i4acgQLVy8hy-V1cV7EdfZPMP_jFQ=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>RiME.
  (Image credit: Tequila Works)</p></figcaption></figure>  <p>There’s something strangely
  soothing about the ambient atmosphere of RiME. Sound, visuals and gameplay come
  together to forge the story of a lost boy, a mysterious island and his journey back
  home. The narrative itself is literally carved into the island world our protagonist
  washes up on. Cave paintings suggest the origins of the strange isle and each mechanical
  puzzle the boy completes unlocks a segment of lost history.&nbsp;</p><p>Guided by
  a magical fox, the boy wanders the island searching each jagged cliff and turquoise
  bay for the answers he seeks. Though the game offers up no definitive resolution,
  elevated musical scores, intricate expressions on the face of our protagonist and
  dream-like cutscenes tell an abstract tale of sorrow, desperation and, most importantly,
  hope.</p>  <h3>The Garden’s Between</h3>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\"
  id=\"yFVuCwfWvyAiuAwqCLtm3M\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/awMGaYIHpyysfNsR4OLUWWZFi1dxLQyfreos1etAbFsaoln64hll_bn_zHdKWwsNgXsZXx89T0eesRkNWSPKBHkT2c454niEr_3wyLd1Og=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>The
  Gardens Between. (Image credit: The Voxel Agents)</p></figcaption></figure>  <p>Puzzle
  games often sacrifice narrative to focus on complex puzzle mechanics. However, this
  is not the case in The Gardens Between. Set on an array of sandbox islands populated
  by a collection of items plucked straight from the memories of childhood friends
  Arina and Frendt, this indie gem combines story and puzzling effortlessly.&nbsp;</p><p>The
  many objects inserted into each colorful stage (things like toy cars, alarm clocks
  and video game consoles) reveal deep truths about the lives and relationships of
  these characters without a single word being spoken. Controlling time is also part
  of the gameplay, suggesting Arina and Frendt want to remain locked in their past
  and present, not willing to separate and move into their own different futures.&nbsp;</p><p>The
  Gardens Between is a heart-wrenching tale of growing up and moving from childhood
  into adulthood, a true coming-of-age tale told in an incredibly original way.</p>
  \ <h3>Old Man’s Journey</h3>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"QUfNSwmKeoRyGCJBsHMqNc\"
  name=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/CtaKfZM5uNb5upzAj9fHUvNT_zwQDn6EFZjA5dpkt1TgsjzcizI4HFs8GghAJjd0M20w3BfzjdCVwwWUXDZuksbRSI0N4UKd_s-oyiPP_w=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>Old
  Man's Journey. (Image credit: Broken Rules)</p></figcaption></figure>  <p>Your aim
  in Old Man’s Journey is to aid an old man on his travels, overcoming puzzles whilst
  taking in the beautiful watercolor world around him. It’s a simple game with simple
  graphics, fuelled by a simple point and click system. But this simplicity is purposeful,
  and allows for the story to be the focal point of the game.</p><p>Guided by the
  contents of a letter he received, our aged protagonist sets out on a quest of both
  self-discovery and reflection, as he moves through lively cities and bustling harbors
  soaked in his own personal history. Wordless cutscenes depicting moments from his
  younger days tell the old man’s story, portraying a certain sadness which lingers
  on even once his hazy memories have been left in the past.</p>  <h3>Journey</h3>
  \ <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"bv46XueuB2wqY5CUzHBk2E\"
  name=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/2vPyPYfs1esbI9R4pFaIDnXvtyCeucyqCzEt_lvGPyeddGJSY4fUjnA1JMruubF0M-9i_yv3QixQSdDJBt7sja5-VeSKA9S04UODJdiwIA=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>Journey.
  (Image credit: Thatgamecompany)</p></figcaption></figure>  <p>Ask anyone who’s played
  Journey for their thoughts on the game and you’re likely to get the same response;
  this game is a masterpiece. Somehow, Journey considers just about all of life’s
  big questions without the utterance of a single word.&nbsp;</p><p>Fire up the game
  and you’ll be treated to sandy dunes melting into a soft pastel sky with the sole
  point of interest being a bright beacon erupting from a faraway mountain. Our robed
  traveller simply has to get there. However, sun-drenched sands soon turn into dark
  caves, where drastic alteration in the color palate changes the pace and tone of
  the game. The accompanying score is stunning as well, with soaring orchestral swells
  saying more than any conversation ever could.</p>  <h3>Virginia&nbsp;</h3>  <figure><p><img
  align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"kq7QptjASnfxytF5YBNXKW\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/YQcxUJoR12vxG9-IkBTpCj2iWFGXIfOKlydWctlUlCZRfli-l_bnek3eNNcVkZNEA1jDEOkMQvvr_Xtt82g7_U-PmUj4GKZIDNIpoQ-bYg=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>Virginia.
  (Image credit: Variable State)</p></figcaption></figure>  <p>Virginia has been labelled
  by some as a run of the mill walking simulator. However, Virginia offers much more
  than that if, as the player, you’re willing to really dig into what is going on.
  Players control newly ordained FBI agent Anne Tarver as she tackles her first missing
  persons case. Gameplay is sectioned off into forty-two chapters, most filled with
  only seconds or minutes of gameplay before sudden transitions in time and place
  tear you away.&nbsp;</p><p>The overall story of Virginia might appear vague, but
  on a deeper level a seriously worthwhile tale can be pieced together from all the
  metaphorical clues, imagery and soundtrack.</p>  <h3>Abzû</h3>  <figure><p><img
  align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"YKnzVrrJHa8XcaV5kNW4AX\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/sgIaGJoSaSOnyTSayLZ0_LZv0MJkH9OyuBFetoyIF8B4bm7mgRiSFyy1DTt5bvU1JFqvqMVDfO63Rvs5yRtWg7Z8Znx5EHYZmaWW2IRaTg=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>&nbsp;Abzû.
  (Image credit: Giant Squid Studios)</p></figcaption></figure>  <p>At first glance
  Abzû seems to focus on delivering nothing more than a relaxing, colorful marine
  experience. But, just like the real-life seas Abzû draws inspiration from, there
  is so much more lurking beneath the surface. The ocean acts as the player’s world
  and, as the water flows from secluded coves into the bottomless mass of open water,
  the playable diver will be pulled through them on an unconquerable current.&nbsp;</p><p>Abzû’s
  narrative is hidden in strange dream sequences which may not initially make sense
  when examined on their own, but when you piece them together a powerful story emerges.
  One that will leave you questioning what exactly it is you just witnessed long after
  the credits roll.</p>  <h3>Inside</h3>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\"
  id=\"nGsQwXzhmbyKW9ryPGzBob\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/kRIQhpP5Tm3FGfVlilc8nbyTBrB98dbe2d1aQ4MDrBcBNR8bogDprmDeWTgTHBraQ88o-t8vKZ66gQe5XD4HEfWR4waT3EcAAaaMJGXyvw=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>Inside.
  (Image credit: Playdead)</p></figcaption></figure>  <p>Perhaps the darkest game
  on this list, Inside is a multi award-winning showcase of how a color scheme, tentative
  musical score and intricate backgrounds can elevate a title to excellence.</p><p>Inside
  plays heavily on its 2D puzzler roots but interactions occurring in the Orwellian
  backgrounds slowly begin to raise questions about the nature of the boy’s adventure
  into the strange scientific lab he eventually finds himself lost within. During
  the first few sequences these interactions are vague and forgettable, but they soon
  become unsettling, then disturbing, then something else entirely.&nbsp;</p><p>Without
  any spoken or written text, it’s left to the player to untangle the peculiar story
  of Inside. Fan theories have arisen since the game’s 2016 release, but PlayDead
  (Inside’s developer) have remained silent on a solid answer. Ultimately, the story,
  the boy’s fate, and the reasoning for his journey is all decided by the player.</p>
  \ <h3>Gris</h3>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"57DWeFJ7keHvXCJaUHDrzi\"
  name=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/M21v42sNseaq4Z81OZcRCfpEHnOvLddvyuk5jWjcKGF10bEerpL9yo25M7_JP1NYoCu8UQ5tK8kDEJaXUV3RnVUgIfem1MtgCfpJArjG3g=s0-d\"></p><figcaption><p>Gris.
  (Image credit: Nomada Studio)</p></figcaption></figure>  <p>Gris tackles one of
  life’s most difficult emotions, grief. Against the blank canvas of a white sky,
  a female figure casts a lonely silhouette. Falling from the heavens, she eventually
  lands far below on a desolate landscape devoid of color.&nbsp;</p><p>As the girl
  moves through the abandoned world, she gradually returns color to it, an elegant
  metaphor for the journey back from tragedy. Each color represents a particular emotion
  and adds another element of depth to both the story and the main character, emphasising
  our connection with her and powering the emotional tale. Color is the language the
  developers use to communicate a story here, and it resonates on a deep and powerful
  level.</p>  <ul><li><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/the-7-best-adventure-games-on-pc\">Best

  each of these new GPUs will also have laptop equivalent versions.</p><p>The Nvidia
  GeForce GTX 1650 has apparently appeared in a 3DMark entry – for a <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/us/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-top-5-gaming-notebooks-reviewed-1258471\"><u>gaming

  target=\"_blank\"><u>TUM APISAK</u></a>, we can surmise that the mobile version
  of the GTX 1650 will feature a base clock of 1,395MHz, with 4GB of GDDR5 video memory
  operating at 8Gbps speeds on a 128-bit memory bus.</p><p>Comparatively, the Nvidia
  GTX 1050 Ti found in current gaming laptops comes with a 1,345MHz base clock, 4GB
  of GDDR5 VRAM (7Gbps) and a 128-bit memory bus. So it looks like the GTX 1650 could
  add a nice bump in power for entry-level gaming laptops, if the rumors are true.</p>

  only heard</a> it will feature 4GB of GDDR5 video memory.</p><p>It looks like the

  \ <p>The iPad Pro 11 is the best iPad you can buy right now. It may be expensive,
  but it's Apple's most powerful tablet and furthers the 2-in-1 design ethos if you
  spring for the pricey new keyboard cover folio.&nbsp;</p><p>It has a laptop-like
  experience in design and performance, and the new Apple Pencil magnetically clips
  onto the frame of the new iPad Pro. With superb speakers and a great new screen-to-body
  ratio, it's hard not to fall in love with the finely crafted hardware design.&nbsp;</p><p>However,
  there are setbacks for the iPad Pro 11 that you should be aware of. The iOS 12 software
  feels limiting when trying to multitask and perform laptop-like tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>Another
  strictly mobile challenge: it doesn't have a headphone jack. If you want the standard
  3.5mm jack in a computer-like device, you'll spring for an actual computer.</p><p>Everything
  about the iPad Pro 11 makes it the best experience if you're looking for the best
  Apple tablet - you'll just need to swallow the high price - but it's no MacBook
  replacement. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read the full review: </strong><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/ipad-pro-11\"><strong>iPad

  \ <p>This is the best tablet for the average consumer and for education, even if
  it isn't the most powerful one on sale. It's simply a great value.&nbsp;</p><p>The
  new iPad (2018) replaces the very similar 2017 model and, before that, the iPad
  Air 2 in Apple's lineup, slotting in below the Pro range.</p><p>It works with the
  Apple Pencil, offering you the cheapest way to doodle on the 9.7-inch glass, though
  you can't get the Smart Keyboard with this non-Pro model. It also has the same luxurious
  metal unibody as the rest of Apple's iPad range, though notably it's ever-so-slightly
  thicker than the iPad Air 2 or iPad Pro at 7.5mm.</p><p>With the Touch ID fingerprint
  sensor included, iOS 12 under the hood and up to 10 hours of battery life when web
  browsing or watching videos, it's a great media player and a strong tablet choice
  if you're not planning to use it heavily for productivity.</p><p><strong>Read the

  \ <p>We really like the iPad Pro 12.9 for its large size and it's the closest thing
  we have to a 2-in-1 touchscreen MacBook. It just happens to run iOS 12 instead of
  macOS.&nbsp;</p><p>It's the best productivity and entertainment tablet around thanks
  to its 12.9-inch screen, four speakers and the iOS 12 dock and multitasking interface.
  Apple has redesigned its Control Center interface to make app switching even easier,
  and this tablet is compatible with the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard.</p><p>It's
  biggest weakness? The iPad Pro 12.9-inch price, and the size isn't a good fit for
  everyone. But If you can afford it and want the largest-sized iPad available, you're
  going to love this – it's a laptop-replacement for a lot people out there.</p><p><strong>Read

  being a true desktop replacement.</p><p>If you're looking for a premium Android

  the power is decent - if not a well-known chipset running things. It's worth noting
  it's running Android Nougat software though, and Asus has yet to tell us if or when
  it'll get the latest Android Oreo upgrade.</p><p>The battery life and build quality
  aren't quite up to Apple's standards, but then again, neither is the price - a good

  find anywhere else on the internet</a> - and it's absolutely outstanding.</p><p>It's
  a tariff that starts great and then get's better the more you hear. On the face
  of it, you get the Samsung Galaxy S10e handset on a two year contract, with unlimited
  calls and texts and 1GB of data per month for £27.99 per month after paying £99.99
  at the start. That's a total cost of £771, which is already far cheaper than anything
  else out there. And you can save another tenner if you enter the code IDMOFF10 at
  the checkout.</p><p>If that all sounds ideal to you except that you fear that 1GB
  of data may be just a little bit stingy for your streaming, surfing and social media
  needs, then iD has another trick up its sleeve...a 50GB data boost that you can
  save up and use anytime that you head over the 1GB limit, thus tripling you effective
  monthly data limit. You won't find a better S10e bargain online.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\"

  has helped more than 300,000 developers to fix more than 1,000,000 apps on Google

  \ <h3>Vulnerabilities covered</h3>  <p>According to the company, the program covers
  a broad range of issues with Android apps from security issues in certain versions
  of popular libraries all the way to unsafe TLS/SSL certificate validation.</p><p>Google
  is continuously working to improve the program and in 2018, it deployed warnings
  for six additional security vulnerability classes including SQL injection, file-based
  cross-site scripting, cross-app scripting, leaked third-party credentials, scheme
  hijacking and JavaScript interface injection.</p><p>The company plans to evolve
  the program as new exploits emerge and will continue developing it throughout 2019.</p><p>Google
  hopes to see the program grow in the coming years to help developers worldwide build

  granted the wishes of Elder Scrolls fans everywhere when studio boss Todd Howard
  confirmed at E3 2018 that the developer is working on the highly-anticipated The
  Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p>Although we only got a glimpse at a short teaser trailer,
  rumors immediately started speculating about where the latest Elder Scrolls title
  will be set, when it will release and when we will hear more.&nbsp;</p><p>So we've
  gathered and assessed all the news and rumors about The Elder Scrolls 6 in this
  handy guide. Here's everything you need to know.</p><p><em>[</em><em><strong>Update:</strong></em><em>
  It looks like The Elder Scrolls 6 could be further away than we hoped.]</em></p>
  \ <h3>Cut to the chase</h3>  <ul><li><strong>What is it?</strong> The highly anticipated
  sequel to the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</li><li><strong>When can I play it? </strong>Not
  soon</li><li><strong>What can I play it on?</strong> PC is a safe bet, as well as
  the latest console generations</li></ul>  <h3>Elder Scrolls 6 release date – when
  can I play it?</h3>  <p>We might as well get the bad news out of the way first –
  you’re not likely to be playing The Elder Scrolls 6 any time soon. The good news,
  however, is that it’s been confirmed you will be able to...<em>eventually</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The
  game was confirmed during Bethesda's E3 2018 conference but nothing more than a
  logo was given. We don't even have a subtitle or a release year. Todd Howard said
  that the game will be coming after <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/starfield-release-date-trailers-and-news\">Starfield</a>,
  the company's next big IP. That means Elder Scrolls 6 could be years away.</p><p>In
  addition, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMhloY9lwk0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=158\"
  target=\"_blank\">Youtuber SkullziTV</a> (via <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/elder-scrolls-6-release-date-location-news-races/\"
  target=\"_blank\">GamesRadar</a>) has been looking into the challenges Bethesda's
  parent company ZeniMax faces with regards to the Redfall trademark it has applied
  for. According to SkullziTV, trial dates suggest we won't be seeing any mentions
  of Redfall (aka the rumored name of the upcoming Elder Scrolls game) until after
  August 2020. &nbsp;</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"FwUZxFsZwd2vsjYwPtCSdQ\"

  \ <h3>Elder Scrolls 6 trailer – when can I watch it?</h3>  <p>The only footage we
  have of Elder Scrolls 6 is a very short clip of the game's logo. Other than that,
  you might be waiting a while to see more. We think E3 2019 is a safe bet. Or maybe
  it'll leak beforehand.</p><p>Here's the announcement trailer:</p>  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkFdqqyI8y4\"></iframe>
  \ <h3>Elder Scrolls 6 rumors</h3>  <p><strong>It may be called the Elder Scrolls
  6: Redfall</strong></p><p>Bethesda may have trademarked the name for the Elder Scrolls
  6. According to a report by <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/elder-scrolls-6-news-redfall-bethesda-trademark-1125159\"
  rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Newsweek</a>, ZeniMax Media (Bethesda's parent
  company) filed a new trademark for 'Redfall' which the company stated was for a
  'computer game software for use with computers and video game consoles'.&nbsp;</p><p>It's
  nothing solid, but there's a slim chance the new Elder Scrolls will be called Elder
  Scrolls 6: Redfall. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/9gm6sl/bethesda_filed_a_new_trademark_on_the_10th_of/\">Redditors</a>
  are speculating the name is linked to the Redfall location in Tamriel or to the
  Redguard race in Elder Scrolls, however Bethesda has not confirmed or denied anything.</p>
  \ <h3>Elder Scrolls 6 news</h3>  <p><strong>It's official</strong></p><p>Bethesda
  is a busy studio: not only is it working on a brand new IP, it's also continuing
  to develop for Elder Scrolls Online and it's taking on the long commitment of Fallout
  76. And that's only in its main RPG franchises. It's still got plenty going on elsewhere
  with mobile games, Dishonored, Prey and others.</p><p>Thanks to Todd Howard, we
  know Bethesda is working on two huge new titles simultaneously, though their developments
  are staggered.&nbsp;</p><p>We now know that one of them is the Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p>Having
  returned to Skyrim after some time away, Howard compared it to seeing an old friend
  from high school, adding that the time away had given him the chance to see Skyrim
  as a gamer for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>This, to us, would be the perfect time
  to start applying this new perspective to the next title in the series.&nbsp;</p><p>At
  the very least we can say we know it won’t just be called Elder Scrolls 6. There’s
  going to be a colon and another word to round the title off if previous releases
  are anything to go by.&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Where will Elder Scrolls 6 be set?</h3>  <p>We’re
  also willing to bet that like all the other games in the series it’s going to be
  set in the continent of Tamriel, the map of which is below.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\"
  fullscreen=\"\" id=\"pAd8ec5pqY3PmzJdRNyTEe\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/rcvS1GFKgu3R2vccjKX12rLvKzGgk2ojQxIQiEHrRsXPpMFxzvtPsJKbZPGAymTMRGKWbl7ok8m97xp2p9eI3qRlkA1TvD7MScUbx99veQ=s0-d\"></p>
  \ <p>Previous games have taken us to Highrock, Hammerfell, Morrowind, Cyrodil, and
  Skyrim. Valenwood, Elsweyr and Black Marsh are the biggest places left to explore.
  Though there’s still much of Morrowind left to explore, we imagine much of that
  will be covered in the upcoming Elder Scrolls Online title.&nbsp;</p><p>So, Valenwood,
  Elsweyr or Black Marsh. Which looks most likely? Rumors online are heavily pointing
  towards Black Marsh, the home of the world’s reptilian Argonian race.&nbsp;</p><p>There
  isn’t actually any solid reason for this rumor, but its swampy marshlands and network
  of islands would make for an interesting geographic change for the series, though
  it’s a geography that would leave itself open to comparison with the Witcher 3.
  &nbsp;It’s probably the region of Tamriel that we know the least about so Bethesda
  would have plenty of room to be creative.</p><p>That said, Elsweyr would also be
  an interesting geography change with its dry plains and harsh badlands that the
  Khajit call home.&nbsp;</p><p>It would certainly be nice to find out more about
  the culture of either the Khajit or the Argonians so both of these extremely different
  settings have an understandable appeal to fans.</p><p>There is, however, weight
  to a rumor that Elder Scrolls 6 could be set in Valenwood. Valenwood is the home
  of the Bosmer and it’s an area of Tamriel that Bethesda hasn’t explored much.&nbsp;</p>

  \ <p>The rumor that the game will be set here is based on a reported <a href=\"http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=fb-frednelson123881A189E4-D43C-93ED-48C1-A953ACC58543.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\">internal Bethesda memo</a> from all the way back in 2014. In this
  memo, Bethesda employees were reportedly wanted against using the terms Fallout:
  Nuka World, Elder Scrolls VI or Project Greenheart.</p><p>Though it was initially
  believed to be a fake, Fallout: Nuka World ended up being a big DLC release for
  Fallout 4 which gives slightly more weight to rumor that Project Greenheart is in
  fact the codename for the next Elder Scrolls title. The fact that Greenheart is
  a city in the verdant region of Valenwood makes this even more interesting.&nbsp;</p><p>Forest
  and jungle settings are hard to get right in games and it’d be really interesting
  to see Bethesda get creative with the part of Tamriel that’s said to have rejected
  civilization and embraced the wilderness.&nbsp;</p><p>It's hard to tell from the
  short E3 clip we have of the game but our first impression is that the game world
  looks a lot more like Valenwood or Elsweyr than Black Marsh.</p><p>In an interview
  with <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-28-yes-todd-howard-and-team-have-settled-on-a-region-for-the-elder-scrolls-6\"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>,
  Todd Howard confirmed the team has settled on the location - but he won't tell us
  where yet.&nbsp;</p>  <h3>What features can we expect?</h3>  <p><strong>Homebuilding</strong></p><p>A
  feature that we’re fairly certain will be included in the game to some degree is
  house building or town creation. Skyrim introduced the idea of designing and maintaining
  a homestead with its Hearthfire DLC, which Fallout 4 expanded upon with the introduction
  of its settlement mechanic and the Elder Scrolls online built upon again with its
  Homestead DLC. This leads neatly into a further expansion of such features in the
  next Elder Scrolls title as it felt not-quite-finished in Fallout.&nbsp;</p><p>It
  would be a feature that would actually fit in particularly well with the rumored
  Valenwood setting, if it involved the player adapting to the wilderness in the way
  the resident Bosmer have with their treetop cities. In a similar way the player
  used debris and junk to craft their settlement in Fallout, they could use their
  natural environment to do so in Elder Scrolls in a nice contrast.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\"

  \ <p><strong>A whole new story</strong></p><p>In a recent interview with <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-and-fallout-4-still-have-millions-of-daily-/1100-6448014/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Gamespot</a>, Todd Howard said that Bethesda is looking into how
  exactly it tells stories in its games.</p><p>Howard noted that Skyrim and Fallout
  4 take slightly different approaches to stories, with Skyrim leaving things more
  open to the player’s vision and Fallout guiding them more firmly through a story</p><p>Now
  he says the studio are looking how to “tell a better story in an open world.” &nbsp;He
  said “each of our games we've had successes and failures and if you ask us internally,
  we have new ideas that we want to explore in the future because we feel like we
  haven't really cracked it yet the way we think it could be.”</p><p>Being aware of
  the differences between Skyrim and Fallout’s approaches to storytelling and the
  fact that both have positives and negatives suggests that the next Elder Scrolls
  title could strike some kind of balance between giving the player completely free
  reign and telling a story around their character.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard to deny
  that The Witcher 3 has had a massive impact on what players expect in terms of including
  an engaging story in an open world game.&nbsp;</p><p>Though we don’t in any way
  want Bethesda to just churn out a Witcher copy (we’re not sure it’d be possible
  anyway) it does put a certain amount of pressure on Bethesda when it comes to achieving
  high-quality environmental and quest-based story telling.&nbsp;</p><p>Something
  we don’t expect to see, though, is multiplayer. Skyrim certainly doesn’t suffer
  from a lack of multiplayer and it wouldn’t really make all that much sense to incorporate
  any online multiplayer gameplay with the Elder Scrolls Online still rolling along.&nbsp;</p>

  \ <p><strong>Virtual reality</strong></p><p>It's not a certainty by any means but
  the fact that Bethesda released a full VR experience for Skyrim means it's not out
  of the question.</p>  <h3>What would we like to see?</h3>  <p><img align=\"middle\"
  fullscreen=\"\" id=\"UFZYKYTpQesPQEErW9egFH\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/jdPDUOmLBefxB8Xg9aVPv4PxEgGgm7ckYqmVEwHvKYEIIhrJKd-TrQsknJrey0bndlBqDOCQ3PC9B-YX1AhgtAsIPOUf3ugZtNk_jfkHvA=s0-d\"></p>
  \ <p>Well, something we’d like to see and fully expect to see is improved graphics
  and reduced bugginess. The remastered version of Skyrim showed just how far things
  have come visually since the game’s first release so we fully expect any title following
  on from it to be of that standard if not much higher, depending on how far away
  the game is.</p><p>There’s actually a fairly good chance that the game could be
  created using an entirely new game engine – after it created an entirely new engine
  for Skyrim we don’t think it’s unlikely Bethesda will do the same for Elder Scrolls
  6 and any Fallout sequels.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bethesda game studio in Montreal is currently
  <a href=\"https://jobs.zenimax.com/requisitions/view/905\" target=\"_blank\">looking
  to hire</a> an engine programmer so it’s well worth watching this space.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(Image

  can mean anything from cracking an egg to matching the right wine with a meal. It’s
  baking and barbeque, managing a kitchen, and designing dishes that look gorgeous
  on camera. Cooking is an art. It’s about improvisation, trying new things, making
  mistakes, and creating delicious food. The culinary ocean is both wide and deep
  - so why haven’t cooking games reflected that?</p><p>TechRadar spoke to some of
  the leading indie developers in the field to learn about the challenges they face
  in trying to serve up an authentic culinary experience, and how they're leading
  the charge in spicing up the cooking game genre.&nbsp;</p>  <h3>Whisky business</h3>

  Battle Chef Brigade is an anime-style action RPG which combines combo-based hunting
  and puzzle-based cooking in a narrative-driven adventure. It's a far cry from the
  cooking games we're used to seeing and a much-needed breath of fresh air for the
  genre.</p>  <figure><blockquote><p>\"The actual complexity of what people do in

  titles have been restricted to a few categories for as long as we can remember.
  They’re either fun, mini-game oriented titles where you follow a recipe like Cooking
  Mama or restaurant management-focused games like Diner Dash. It doesn’t help that
  cooking systems inside larger games, like Breath of the Wild, are usually nothing
  more than crafting systems. While some kooky exceptions to the rule exist - like
  the Japanese PlayStation game Ore no Ryomi, Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido on
  <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nintendo-switch\">Nintendo Switch</a>,
  and Supreme Pizza Empire on Steam - there's still plenty of room for improvement.</p><p>“We
  started off with a system where you could make pretty much anything,\" Eastman explains.
  \"We quickly ran into the problem where there was an infinite list of things the
  player could make, so we had to limit ourselves.</p><p>\"It was really hard for
  the player to understand how well they made a dish if they were following a real
  world recipe. That’s where the fantasy element came in. We also needed a way to
  construct the cooking in an understandable and approachable way; that’s the road
  that led to judges scoring based off categories.”</p>  <h3>Chop and change</h3>

  \ <p>The developers of Battle Chef Brigade, Overcooked, and Cook, Serve, Delicious!
  all agree that the lack of depth in the genre is due to how hard it is to accurately
  capture cooking in game form. They all know first hand as well, since they had to
  cut large swaths of their games due to complexity, including an actual recipe book
  that players could use in Overcooked and a whole food plating mini game in Battle
  Chef Brigade. Several of those cut segments could easily be a entire game on their
  own.&nbsp;</p><p>“A cooking game is any game that focuses on food as its primary
  goal, where you’re preparing or serving it first and foremost. Anything could be
  a cooking game,” Cook, Serve, Delicious! developer David Galindo tells TechRadar.
  “Plenty of games have proven that too. I didn’t think a match three puzzle could
  be a cooking game, but that’s part of what Battle Chef Brigade is and it's very
  much a cooking game.”</p><p>One surefire method that developers of games like Battle
  Chef Brigade use is focusing development on a singular concept. Trinket Studios
  wanted to capture the vibe and showmanship of a cooking competition in an action
  game, Galindo wanted to share the feeling of dread he experienced at his barista
  job and turn the feeling of being overwhelmed into anxiety-ridden fun, and Ghost
  Town Games focused solely on the chaos that erupts in the physical space of the
  kitchen.</p>  <figure><blockquote><p>\"The nice thing with cooking as a genre is
  that it comes with universal appeal.\"</p><figcaption><cite>Ollie De-Vine - Ghost
  Town Games</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>  <p>“Most cooking games focus
  on the minutiae, the manipulation of the items. We wanted to deal with it in the
  moment for Overcooked. We wanted it to be about cooperation more than anything else
  really,” says Phil Duncan, one of the minds behind Overcooked. “We didn’t start
  from a cooking angle, we wanted to make games that were good for cooperative play
  and we fell into cooking.”</p><p>Overcooked didn’t have to be a series about cooking
  - the team could’ve easily made it about cleaning, construction, or even gray boxes
  pushing around other, even grayer boxes in order to achieve some perfect assembly
  of gray boxes. They chose cooking to make their chaotic cooperative mechanics easily
  accessible to a wide audience, since everyone knows how to make a burger.</p><p>“Initially,
  we didn’t think of Overcooked as a cooking game, although the game has cooking in
  the name and all you do is cook,” said Ollie De-Vine, the other half of Ghost Town
  Games. “The nice thing with cooking as a genre is that it comes with universal appeal.”</p><p>“It
  hasn’t been explored as much though, there are whole waves of the cooking system
  that we’ve ignored,” he adds. “Experimenting with ingredients, preparation techniques,
  and other parts of the process are missing. The difficulty comes from where you
  have to gamify them.”</p>  <h3>Penne for your thoughts</h3>  <figure><p><img align=\"middle\"

  2. (Image credit: Ghost Town Games)</p></figcaption></figure>  <p>The list of cooking
  elements that games haven’t explored is as long as they come - since everything
  from table etiquette to actually growing the food in a garden can be considered
  part of the genre. You could fill an entire 20-hour game with the intricacies and
  logistics of farm-to-table or you could create a Flight Control-esque game where
  you plot out the paths of the wait staff through increasingly complicated restaurant
  floor plans. The number of possibilities is endless, and it didn’t take long for
  the developers we spoke to to pop off a few ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>Eastman talked about
  creating a game that is all about plating food according to different aethstetics,
  De-Vine and Duncan floated the idea of creating a game where you sing to plants
  to help them grow (dubbed PhotoSINGthesis), and Galindo said he loved the idea of
  a ‘Sims Cuisine’ where you manage an entire restaurant franchise. Obviously it’s
  easier to talk about ideas than actually create them, but it still means that there’s
  a wealth of ideas to explore if designers feel so inclined.&nbsp;</p><p>“Cooking
  is a well understood, but fairly complicated process. If you simplify part of that
  down then people can use intuition to understand how fairly complicated things work,”
  Eastman said. “Don’t do what we did where we approached improvisational cooking
  as a goal with no idea how to tackle it. Whatever you choose, you’ll need to simplify
  it to make it a good system for a game, focus on the mechanics and not the food
  itself.”</p>  <ul><li><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/10-best-indie-games-top-indie-games-on-pc-and-consoles-1300583\">Best

  to the home of the best cheap MacBook Pro prices. Here at TechRadar, we check around
  for the cheapest MacBook Pro deals in the sales every day at the top retailers on
  the net. So you're certainly in the right place to save money on your new Apple
  laptop. Better yet, we've just updated our guide with the latest models. We've still
  included the earlier models, as some of them are a lot cheaper.&nbsp;</p><p>The
  MacBook Pro has become the go to laptop range for professionals and enthusiasts
  alike, absolutely powering through tasks regular laptops fear. Apple's staggering
  lineup of Retina screens lead the way for crisp visuals and the increasingly excellent
  physical design of the laptops themselves has seen the latest MacBook Pro usurp
  the svelte form of the MacBook Air. You want the best there is, but there's no reason
  to pay more than you should for it. If you want to save some money you could check

  \ <p>The 2018 version of the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro is the best yet, comes with
  the Touch Bar as standard and features a range of improvements over the older models.
  The screen resolution may be the same with the excellent Retina display, but now
  there's True Tone technology inside that senses ambient lighting in the room or
  outdoors to adjust the brightness of the screen for the best possible picture. The
  keyboard is quieter and less 'clicky' too. You're getting the brand new 8th-gen
  Coffee Lake core processor and the quad-core CPUs have doubled the performance of
  the 2017 models. With more options for larger RAM too, options really open up for
  creatives and professionals with the MacBook Pro 2018.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\"

  \ <p>The larger 15-inch version of the 2018 MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar is generally
  going to cost a fair bit more than the 13-inch model, but that's not just because
  of the larger screen. This model packs a lot more under the hood too, with Apple
  providing multiple options with increased RAM, extra processing power with a six
  core Coffee Lake processor and larger SSD storage options. Naturally, you're getting
  the same improvements over the 2017 version too like the True Tone screen technology
  and quieter keyboard. This really is a powerhouse laptop for designers and industry
  creatives. If you don't need all the power though, we'd consider the cheaper 13-inch
  model, or maybe even one of the older versions found below if the prices are right
  for you.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"BHkL6ybxHaSaxCr2P7dqm7\"

  \ <h3>The best Macbook Pro with Touch Bar (2017) prices</h3>  <p><strong>2017 update:</strong>
  The 2017 lineup has recently been released too. The newer models aren't a massive
  upgrade over the 2016 lineup. Actually the -admittedly still excellent- retina display
  and overall size are the same. If you're looking for increased performance, you're
  in luck as the new models have been upgraded to include the 7th-gen Kaby Lake processor
  chips for enhanced 4K streaming and media editing.</p><p>The new 2017 MacBook Pros
  will eventually phase out the older models, which means you'll more than likely
  be able to snag a cheap MacBook Pro deal on the older laptops.</p>  <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/cheap-macbook-deals-1295699\"><p><img

  \ <p>2016 was crying out for a refresh of the MacBook Pro and Apple once again come
  up with something rather special. In addition to the internal spec getting a long
  awaited upgrade and that gorgeous Retina display (available in 13-inch and 15-inch
  flavours), Apple has introduced their long-rumoured Touch Bar technology. This mini-LED
  display replaces the Function keys and comes up with different touch display controls
  for an increasing number of programs. Uses so far include Safari bookmarks, predictive
  text, search field, emojis, photo galleries or even more intensive actions like
  photo editing or mixing records. Simple, yet innovative. Expect rival firms to start
  copying it soon.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"3otsebfzNxbgzqWhhpiRsY\"

  \ <p>This new 13-inch MacBook Pro is the cheapest way to get your hands on one of
  Apple's latest laptops, released in late 2016. This is the lightest MacBook Pro
  ever made, but still packs an incredible punch with 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core
  i5 or 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor options. You don't get the new Touch
  Bar on this version, but you do get a Retina display and the new larger trackpad.
  Prices start around $1,499/£1,449/AU$2,199. Stay updated on the latest prices in
  the comparison chart below.</p>  <h3>MacBook Pro 13-inch - no Touch Bar (2017)</h3>
  \ <p><strong>2017 update:</strong> Just like the aforementioned Touch Bar models,
  the screen and shape are unchanged since the 2016 models. You are getting the new
  Kaby Lake 7th-gen processor though.&nbsp;</p><p>2016's lineup was very expensive,
  which is why we're delighted to see that Apple has released an even cheaper 13-inch
  model for an entry-level, but still very modern, MacBook Pro experience. This does
  come at the cost of a smaller storage capacity though, with the cheapest options
  including a 128GB SSD instead of 256GB.</p><p>These new 2017 models will start to
  phase out some of the older ones, so keep an eye on our comparison charts as we
  expect to see some tasty discounts on the 2016 crew as retailers make way for the
  new breed.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"fTPRMDusrwfnauGNXrzELS\"

  \ <p>The 2015 MacBook Pro didn't undergo a dramatic reimagining, but then there
  wasn't anything particularly wrong with it in the first place. Improvements to its
  performance mean it's better value than before, and the noticeably improved battery
  life makes it even more of a mobile workhorse. As ever the cost of adding memory
  and storage soon sends the price tag into orbit, but even the stock MacBook Pro
  is an incredibly versatile computer and arguably Apple's best ever laptop. Newer
  MacBooks may be more portable, but the Pro has all the power.&nbsp;</p>  <p><img

  \ <p>If you're looking for the larger-sized laptop experience in the MacBook range,
  you'll be wanting to take a look at the seriously impressive specs of the 2015 model
  15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display. The Intel Core i7 2.5 Ghz processor combined
  with 16GB of RAM will make light work of anything you can throw at it. 512GB of
  super fast flash storage, a new Force Touch trackpad and that incredible four million
  pixel-packing display make this one of the best laptops in the business.</p>  <ul><li>Keep

  Maybe you need the lightest and most portable <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/macos-1013-high-sierra-release-date-news-and-features\">macOS</a>
  machine out there today, one with good battery life. Or, maybe you just don’t like
  Windows? Whatever your reason, there are plenty of deals out there to help you save
  on a MacBook deal.</p><p>Our exclusive price comparison tool will check the price
  of every readily available model of MacBook on all major retail websites, so you
  can be sure you’re always getting the best MacBook deal. We've stopped comparing
  MacBook prices on some older models if they're not widely available or if they generally
  cost more than newer versions despite the dated tech inside. All you need to do
  now is work out whether it’s a <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/macbook-1287806/review\">MacBook</a>,

  \ <p>The 2018 version of the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro is the best yet, comes with
  the Touch Bar as standard and features a range of improvements over the older models.
  The screen resolution may be the same with the excellent Retina display, but now
  there's True Tone technology inside that senses ambient lighting in the room or
  outdoors to adjust the brightness of the screen for the best possible picture. The
  keyboard is quieter and less 'clicky' too. You're getting the brand new 8th-gen
  Coffee Lake core processor and the quad-core CPUs have doubled the performance of
  the 2017 models. With more options for larger RAM too, options really open up for
  creatives and professionals with the MacBook Pro 2018.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\"

  \ <p>The larger 15-inch version of the 2018 MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar is generally
  going to cost a fair bit more than the 13-inch model, but that's not just because
  of the larger screen. This model packs a lot more under the hood too, with Apple
  providing multiple options with increased RAM, extra processing power with a six
  core Coffee Lake processor and larger SSD storage options. Naturally, you're getting
  the same improvements over the 2017 version too like the True Tone screen technology
  and quieter keyboard. This really is a powerhouse laptop for designers and industry
  creatives. If you don't need all the power though, we'd consider the cheaper 13-inch
  model, or maybe even one of the older versions found below if the prices are right
  for you.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"FAdNZxL5pFmiy55Q3V825X\"

  \ <h3>The cheapest MacBook Air (2017) sale prices</h3>  <p><em><strong>The MacBook
  Air series is making a comeback</strong></em></p><p>We have to admit, we thought
  Apple was done with the MacBook Air line after the new Pro lineup was just as compact
  and almost as light. Apple has given the 13-inch MacBook Air its first update since
  2015 though. This means you can now get a much healthier 8GB of RAM instead of 4GB
  along with a processor upgrade to 1.8GHz (over 1.6GHz) making it much better at
  multi-tasking.&nbsp;Older MacBook Air stock is gradually disappearing from retailers
  now although prices have been stubbornly high even on refurbs. In all honesty, you're
  getting much better value by opting for this modern version instead.</p>  <p><img

  \ <h3>The cheapest Macbook (2017) prices</h3>  <p><em><strong>The Kaby Lake upgrade
  you've been waiting for?</strong></em></p><p>The screen and compact dimensions on
  the 2017 MacBook are the same as the 2016 edition. But if you're weighing up the
  actual differences between the new 2017 and 2016 MacBooks, here are some key points
  to consider. You're now getting the 7th-gen Kaby Lake processors with i5 and i7
  options now available. 2015 MacBook owners are more likely to appreciate the improvements
  really. The prices we're seeing lately though aren't that much more expensive than
  the 2016 models.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"BHkL6ybxHaSaxCr2P7dqm7\"

  \ <h3>MacBook Pro (2017) 13 and 15-inch deals (with Touch Bar) &nbsp;</h3>  <p><em><strong>A
  touch above the rest?</strong></em></p><p>The 2017 updates to the MacBook Pro lineup
  didn't change an awful lot in all honesty. The main improvement was the upgrade
  to Kaby Lake processors. The 7th-gen chips offer increased performance for 4K streaming
  and media editing. Eventually the 2016 versions will disappear at most retailers,
  but it's worth keeping an eye on the comparison chart below to see if there any
  are discounted models lingering around.</p>  <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/cheap-macbook-deals-1295699\"><p><img

  \ <h3>MacBook Pro (2016) 13 and 15-inch deals (with Touch Bar)&nbsp;</h3>  <p>2016
  was crying out for a refresh of the MacBook Pro and Apple once again came up with
  something rather special. In addition to the internal spec getting a long awaited
  upgrade and that gorgeous Retina display (available in 13-inch and 15-inch flavours),
  Apple introduced its long-rumoured Touch Bar technology. This mini-LED display replaces
  the Function keys and comes up with different touch display controls for loads of
  different programs. Uses so far include safari bookmarks, predictive text, search
  field, emojis, photo galleries or even more intensive actions like photo editing
  or mixing records. Simple, yet innovative.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\"

  \ <h3>2017/2016 MacBook Pro 13-inch deals (no Touch Bar)</h3>  <p><em><strong>The
  2016 and 2017 models are MacBook Air rivals with Pro spec</strong></em></p><p>The
  older 13-inch MacBook Pros are amongst the cheaper options if you want to go Pro.
  These versions don't come with a Touch Bar which is something to factor in when
  comparing how much you'll save versus the added functionality the new tech could
  add to your work and computing life in general.</p><p>These are incredibly light
  for MacBook Pros, but they still pack an incredible punch with 2.3GHz (2.0GHz on
  the 2016 model) and dual core processors ranging from i5 to i7. The trackpads are
  larger than older MacBook Pros too and you're getting fantastic Retina displays
  which still look stunning today.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"AZft8wRKZYWpUzNu93CjuV\"

  \ <h3>The best cheap Macbook (2016) sale prices</h3>  <p>If you decide that Apple's
  mini marvel is for you, you're getting one of the best Macbooks Apple's ever made.
  With faster internals than the outdated 2015 model , it's capable of zipping through
  lesser-demanding tasks without complaining and leaves you with more confidence to
  get the job done. Plus, well, <em>look</em> at it.</p>  <p><img align=\"\" alt=\"cheap

  \ <h3>MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina display (2015) deals</h3>  <p><em><strong>The
  older and smaller MacBook Pro is still a force of nature</strong></em></p><p>The
  2015 MacBook Pro didn't undergo a dramatic reimagining, but then there wasn't anything
  particularly wrong with it in the first place. Improvements to its performance meant
  it was better value than before, and the noticeably improved battery life makes
  it even more of a mobile workhorse.</p>  <h3>MacBook Pro 15-inch with Retina display
  (2015) deals</h3>  <p><em><strong>Looking for something a bit bigger?</strong></em></p><p>If
  you're looking for the larger-sized laptop experience in the MacBook range, the
  2015 model 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display is still an impressive piece
  of kit and arguably worth a shout even today if you can get a good price. The Intel
  Core i7 2.5 GHz processor combined with 16GB of RAM will make light work of anything
  you can throw at it. 512GB of super fast flash storage, a new Force Touch trackpad
  and that incredible four million pixel-packing display make this a fantastic laptop.</p>

  cheap Kindle sale is never that far away in these parts as Amazon is keen to stay
  atop of the ereader pile. Kindle prices on most of the devices are already great
  value given the high quality you get in your hands.</p><p>We're rounding up all
  the cheapest Kindle deals as various retailers throw down to try to offer your the
  best bargains. On this page we'll dig out the discounts on every type of Kindle
  ereader still readily available. If you're interested than just reading books, there
  are the Amazon Fire tablets to consider and they're immeasurably cheaper alternative
  to those pricey iPads.</p><p>While Kindles and Fire tablets are Amazon products,
  you'll find them competitively priced by multiple retailers. Don't worry about having
  to compare and contrast prices though, we'll do the cross-checking to ensure you
  can see the latest Kindle prices from a wide range of stores to ensure you get the
  best price from trustworthy retailers.</p><p>We've got our eye on every model out
  there and have price comparison charts for them all. Everything from the basic Kindle,
  the excellent Paperwhite all-rounder (including the super new 2018 version), all
  the way up to the fancier Kindle Oasis luxury ereader. And the Fire tablet range
  is covered to from the super cheap 7-inch model and up to the larger 10-version
  with the Kids Edition Fire tablets priced and compared too.</p><p>Naturally we'll
  explain the differences between the devices too so you can make the most informed
  decision about which one suits you best. Want more functionality from your tablet?

  deals</a>.</p>  <h3>What makes a good Kindle price?</h3>  <p>If this is your first
  Kindle, you'll be wanting to know - how do you tell a good Kindle sale price when
  you see one? Luckily, there are so many good ones out there it's pretty easy!</p>
  \ <ul><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TRDeals\">Follow @TRDeals on Twitter for
  the latest offers</a></li></ul>  <p>Kindle ereaders don't have LCD screens or powerful
  internal components which means they're usually a lot cheaper than tablets and phones.
  The screens are fantastic for glare-free reading and an immediate improvement over
  using the Kindle app on your phone or tablet.</p><p>If you can find the Kindle Paperwhite
  for under US$129/£120/AU$199 you're getting a good price, while the Kindle 2016
  model (which has all but disappeared from Australian stores) has a fairly static
  price of US$80/£59, but every now and then it dips lower. The top of the line Kindle
  Oasis model prices start at $269/£229/AU$389 and rarely drops lower.</p>  <h3>What
  do 'Special Offers' mean on the Kindle listings?</h3>  <p>When looking at a Kindle
  ereader listing, whether it's on Amazon's website, or on a different retailer's
  site, you'll often see 'includes special offers' in the title or item description.
  Choose without special offers and the price will jump up £10/US$20.</p><p>Essentially,
  these Special Offers act as Amazon-based screensaver-style advertisements on your
  Kindle device. So when you pop your Kindle on from sleep mode you'll see an ad for
  a book on Amazon's Kindle store, or maybe a third party ad.</p><p>Annoying right?
  Actually, I opted for with Special Offers (I do love a cheap deal), and it's not
  bothered me one bit. You can swipe the ad away easily (no trying to find the tiny
  X icon here) and get on with your reading straight away. When in sleep mode, the
  ads cycle on the screen, but they're not illuminated and they don't seem to consume
  any power. They don't slow anything down when powering on the device after shutdown
  either.</p><p>Seeing as they don't interfere with the experience at all, I'm glad
  I didn't spend the extra £10 to block them. Hey, some of them (sales ads etc) have
  been worth clicking through to. If you really don't like them though, you can always
  pay the difference at a later date to get them removed. So we'd opt for the cheaper
  'includes special offers' option first.</p><p><strong>Here are the best cheap Kindle
  prices currently available...</strong></p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" alt=\"waterproof

  \ <h3>Kindle Paperwhite 2018 prices</h3>  <p>Amazon has an updated version of the
  excellent Kindle Paperwhite and it's just been released. And this is no mere by-the-numbers
  update with a deep dive on internal spec sheet required to spot the differences
  (let's leave that to the MacBooks right?). The 2018 version of the Paperwhite is
  so good you might be tempted to ditch the previous version, which we still love
  very much.</p><p>The backlit screen is now flush with the bezel, meaning no more
  places for dust or hair to get stuck. And part of the reasoning behind this upgrade
  is to ensure the Kindle Paperwhite is now a waterproof ereader, just like the far
  more expensive (but absolutely beautiful) Kindle Oasis. The cheapest model now has
  double the storage capacity at 8GB which is handy if you you're reading image-heavy
  books like graphic novels/comics. And it's 20 grams lighter. That extra space is
  also handy for audiobooks, a new addition to the Paperwhite that you can take advantage
  of via bluetooth speakers/headphones.</p><p>We expect prices to drop on the older
  model to clear stock out, so you could get a decent discount there (see further
  down this page for the older Paperwhite prices). As for the new Kindle Paperwhite
  2018, prices start at $129.99/£119.99/AU$199. The 2018 Kindle Paperwhite is well
  on its way to surpassing the previous model, which was already the best value ereader
  on the planet.</p>  <p><img align=\"\" alt=\"kindle paperwhite prices deals sales\"

  \ <h3>Kindle Paperwhite deals</h3>  <p><strong>The best standard Kindle ever is
  a value-for-money winner</strong></p><p>The 6th generation Kindle Paperwhite is
  the best value Kindle yet, it's the most cost effective ereader on the market and
  it easily beats the Kobo Aura on performance and design. Unlike the cheaper model,
  this one comes with screen lighting. Amazon has managed to create a fast electronic
  ink tablet with inventive reading apps. You can lookup words in the dictionary without
  leaving your page, or even flick through any relevant Wikipedia entries for most
  words or terms. The latest version's screen is now just as good as the more expensive
  Voyage model. As far as value for money goes, this is the one to beat.</p>  <p><img
  align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"BX78qprwANfRGztespTkNf\" name=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/AkgmVKVBtq9RJBM8nvVJJVDaVPu6CGkCpoldCp2iSfEWkkIQGFO9FYZi1TaRv7vdI-XeAIPvepT_73MpQ5HI1jRBDN-3dVtP6-S-D_XFVw=s0-d\"></p>
  \ <h3>Amazon Kindle (2016) deals</h3>  <p>The new 2016 Kindle (also known as the
  'All-New Kindle' and ‘Kindle Touch 2016’ in Australia) is the updated version of
  the entry level Kindle last released in 2014. If you want the cheapest option, this
  is the one you should go for as the 2014 version has been discontinued and any deals
  you see are probably for preowned or refurbished units. With prices starting around
  £60/US$80/AU$109 you're getting a bargain. The 2016 model is also available in white
  (the 2014 was black only), it's lighter, thinner, has double the RAM speed and double
  the storage capacity at 4GB. The lack of a lit screen is the only thing holding
  it back really.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"pQFZncppLHEvPKrSecmzyB\"
  name=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/dFqTEd7LbhH7svnL30hysWBDtc23RP8ydYD0DPBWxXY3KHKKtiPBF0ohU1ZnXWhJaigIK8FEU1D3uKuu-iMFgkZwgTWCX2KRw5f1FeRt_w=s0-d\"></p>
  \ <h3>Kindle Oasis deals</h3>  <p><strong>The luxury waterproof ereader you've been
  waiting for?</strong></p><p>The reinvigorated all-new Kindle Oasis costs US$249/£229/AU$389
  for the cheapest Wi-Fi version. This is an upgrade over the older Oasis (which is
  no longer available) and a huge improvement. It's 15% cheaper, bigger and also the
  first waterproof kindle, arguably justifying the top end price-tag. The Kindle Oasis
  is also the first kindle to support Aubidle audio books, although you'll need a
  pair of bluetooth <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-audio/best-wireless-headphones-1280344\"
  target=\"_blank\">wireless headphones</a> to use this feature as there's no built-in
  speaker or 3.5mm headphone port. This new Kindle ereader's 7-inch screen makes it
  the largest in the current Kindle range and tempting for readers wanting to view
  a larger page, meaning you won't have to turn pages as often. The page turn buttons
  are given a wider bezel on the side than the Kindle Voyage, making it easier to
  hold one-handed - the screen will flip over to accommodate left-handed readers too.
  The considerably cheaper Voyage and Paperwhite models are excellent alternatives
  and feature the same screen resolution. That larger screen and waterproofing for
  peace of mind are pretty tempting though.</p>  <p><img align=\"\" alt=\"kindle voyage

  \ <h3>Kindle Voyage deals</h3>  <p><strong>A bit overpriced and outdated in today's
  world</strong></p><p>The Voyage <em>used</em> to be the most expensive Kindle around
  before the Oasis arrived, and it would seem Amazon is slowly <em><strong>phasing
  this model out</strong></em> in favour of it. The Voyage is still one of the best
  ebook readers available. It has a compact design and a sharp screen. Although, the
  last two versions of the far cheaper Paperwhite now comes with the same 300ppi backlit
  screen. The Kindle Voyage has a flush display making the device easy to keep clean,
  adaptive screen lighting for easier lighting adjustments and additional page turning
  buttons. The buttons are a nice feature, but given the new 2018 version of the Kindle
  Paperwhite also has a flush screen <em><strong>and is waterproof</strong></em>,
  the Voyage is too expensive nowadays for us to whole heartedly recommend.&nbsp;</p>
  \ <h3>Amazon tablet deals</h3>  <p>Want something a bit more advanced than a Kindle
  ereader? If your needs are a bit more media-intensive as you want a handheld device
  for gaming, viewing movies (especially on Amazon Prime) and browsing the web, an
  Amazon tablet could be for you. Naturally, there's a Kindle app, but the glass screen
  can be a hindrance for extended reading sessions.</p><p>Australian readers should
  note that these Fire tablets aren't available Down Under.</p>  <p><img align=\"\"

  \ <h3>Amazon Fire 7 deals</h3>  <p><strong>Amazon's most popular Fire tablet</strong></p><p>Sitting
  at the budget end of Amazon's Kindle tablet range, the Fire 7 is generally the cheapest
  of the lot as it doesn't have a HD screen. Amazon has just refreshed the Fire 7
  range though and it now comes with Alexa, the virtual assistant from the Amazon
  Echo devices. You can also have different profiles - some for the kids - through
  Amazon FreeTime.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"MyFGcsMQXBi8kZYkvtDgnK\"

  \ <h3>Amazon Fire HD 8 deals</h3>  <p><strong>The All-New Amazon Fire HD 8 is an
  improved beast</strong></p><p>For this low price, the Amazon Fire HD 8 is one of
  the best tablets around, especially if you're happy to jump into Amazon's ecosystem.
  Mobile gamers will appreciate the improved tech inside the more recent versions
  as it comes with more storage, 50% more RAM and a 1.3GHz processor. Better yet,
  the 2018 edition seen below now comes with integrated hands-free Alexa - the excellent

  \ <h3>Amazon Fire HD 10 deals</h3>  <p>&nbsp;<strong>The All-New Amazon Fire HD
  10 is a much-needed upgraded</strong></p><p>The new and improved Fire HD 10-inch
  tablet finally joins Amazon's other Fire tablets with the 'All-New' treatment. This
  is good news for buyers as this replacement is cheaper than the scant few deals
  available for the old Fire HD 10.</p><p>The cheapest model now comes with 32GB of
  storage instead of 16GB, has a clear full HD 1080p screen and has twice as much
  RAM to run even faster than before. All this and the RRP comes in at just £149/$149.
  The headline feature though is the introduction of the voice-controlled Alexa app
  (one and the same as the Echo devices) to the tablet.</p><p>We're a bit sad to see
  the old aluminium body go, as it looks a little less premium with the plastic finishes
  (black, red and blue available at launch so far). But seeing as we'd be putting
  a protective cover on it anyways, it doesn't really make any difference when we
  think about it.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"qEgAWeebZanb5QrMW7gT8P\"

  \ <h3>Amazon Fire 7 Kids Edition</h3>  <p>Got tech-hungry children, but don't want
  them to get their grubby mitts on your tablet or phone all the time? The Amazon
  Fire Kids Edition tablet could be the answer. In addition to enhanced durability
  (look at the size of that housing), it also comes with a two-year guarantee, which
  covers the tablet -even if the kids break it- no questions asked. There are plenty
  of software safeguards too, such as making sure they can only watch appropriate
  content online, adjustable screen-time limits and access to loads of age-appropriate
  games.</p>  <p><img align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" id=\"V66EBsyXDm9nbuvfzzw3gD\"

  \ <h3>Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Edition</h3>  <p>Bigger and better than the Fire 7 Kids.
  You're getting a larger screen with HD visuals. The sound is better too as the mono
  speaker has been banished for Dolby Atmos and dual stereo speakers. The battery
  has been boosted up to around 12 hours, compared to the eight offered by the smaller
  model and you get 32GB of storage instead of 16GB. You're still getting that same
  tough build quality and two year guarantee too. Come on, don't make your child grow
  up with SD visuals. Doesn't everyone deserve HD, even if they are going to smear
  jam all over it and throw it around a bit?</p>  <p><img align=\"\" alt=\"kindle
