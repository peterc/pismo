  :title: "Cartoon: Apple Tablet: Now With Barometer and Bird Call Generator"
  :feed: http://www.readwriteweb.com/rss.xml
  :lede: I'm just aching to know if the new Apple tablet (insert caveats, weasel words and qualifiers here) is a potential Cintiq competitor. I don't think it will be, but you never know. It may also have a built in barometer and bird call generator. I'm never sure if Apple does themselves more good than harm with the secrecy and anticipation that surrounds the run-up to these announcements.

  :title: Factor's bootstrap process explained
  :lede: "Separation of concerns between Factor VM and library codeThe Factor VM implements an abstract machine consisting of a data heap of objects, a code heap of machine code blocks, and a set of stacks. The VM loads an image file on startup, which becomes the data and code heap. It then begins executing code in the image, by calling a special startup quotation.When new source files are loaded into a running Factor instance by the developer, they are parsed and compiled into a collection of objects -- words, quotations, and other literals, along with executable machine code."

Ze is best-known for his 2006 program "The Show," in which he made a new 2-3 minute video every day for 1 year. Topics ranged from "fingers in food" to the mysteries of airport signage to a tour de force summary of creatives' addiction to un-executed ideas, aka brain crack.
